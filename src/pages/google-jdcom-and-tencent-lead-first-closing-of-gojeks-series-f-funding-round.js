                <b>JAKARTA, 1 February 2019</b> – GOJEK has finalized the first
                closing of its ongoing Series F fundraise. This initial round
                was led by existing investors Google, JD.com, and Tencent, with
                Mitsubishi Corporation and Provident Capital among other
                investors.
              </p>
              <p>
                GOJEK is Southeast Asia’s largest mobile on-demand service and
                payments platform with annualised gross transaction value (GTV)
                across all markets amounting to more than US$9 billion and
                annualised transaction volume of 2 billion by end of 2018. This
                performance is underpinned by the company’s leadership in
                payments and food. The GO-PAY ecosystem processes US$6.3 billion
                of annualised GTV, while GO-FOOD processes US$2 billion in
                annualised GTV making it the largest food delivery service in
                Southeast Asia.
              </p>
              <p>
                The investment demonstrates investor confidence in the growth
                opportunity presented by Southeast Asia’s rapidly expanding
                digital economy, estimated to reach US$240 billion by 2025
                (Google-Temasek e-conomy SEA Report 2018), and GOJEK’s ability
                to unlock that growth by scaling its unique ecosystem model.
                With cash still predominant and about half the adult population
                in the region unbanked (World Bank 2016 report on financial
                inclusion in ASEAN), there is significant opportunity in
                payments and financial services in particular.
              </p>
              <p>
                Launched in January 2015, GOJEK is now a major player in the
                region in key areas of digital and mobile consumption. The
                company has evolved into a super app which acts as a
                transactional ecosystem connecting millions of customers on its
                platform to millions of drivers, merchants, and service
                providers.
              </p>
              <p>
                The funds raised will be used to deepen GOJEK’s market
                penetration across key verticals in Indonesia and strengthen its
                presence in its rapidly expanding regional footprint, following
                the introduction of GOJEK in Singapore, GO-VIET in Vietnam and
                GET in Thailand.
              </p>
              <p>
                The reception by consumers in these markets has exceeded
                expectations. In Vietnam, GO-VIET gained an estimated 40% of the
                two-wheeled transport market share within three months of launch
                in August 2018. GO-VIET’s food delivery service has become the
                leading player among comparable food delivery services within
                only two months of launch in Ho Chi Minh City and recently in
                Hanoi. In Singapore, the GOJEK beta app opened to the general
                public in January 2019 and now offers a very real alternative to
                consumers and drivers alike.
              </p>
              <p>
                Following the close of Series F, GOJEK’s founders will continue
                to maintain control over the decision-making and direction of
                the company, retaining their ability to execute their long-term
                vision and continue to drive rapid business expansion.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Nadiem Makarim, GOJEK Group CEO</b>, said: “Our vision has
                always been to build something truly beneficial for Indonesia
                and to use technology to create positive social impact. By
                focusing on solving problems for our users and partners, GOJEK
                has successfully pioneered the multi-sided platform model where
                millions of people can consume services that address their most
                frequent daily needs and where businesses and entrepreneurs can
                access those consumers, grow their incomes and at the same time
                gain access to crucial financial services.
              </p>

                “We started out with ride-hailing but in short space of time we
                have become Indonesia’s industry leader across all key verticals
                including transport, food delivery, mobile payments, logistics,
                and merchant services. GO-FOOD has become the region’s largest
                food delivery service, while GO-PAY is far ahead of the
                competition as Indonesia’s leading payments platform, used to
                process three-quarters of Indonesia’s mobile payments.

                vision to more countries and at the same time put Indonesia on
                the map as a regional hub for tech innovation. GOJEK and its
                affiliates now operate in five countries and 204 cities and
                regencies across Southeast Asia and we have a network of over 2
                million driver partners and 400,000 merchants."
              </p>
              <p>
                “The successes we have enjoyed are testament to GOJEK’s unique
                ability to create social value at scale, as well as value for
                our investors, and this latest round of fundraising speaks to
                the confidence investors have in the team’s ability to execute
                our vision.”

              <p className="font-weight-bold">FACT SHEET</p>
              <p>
                Southeast Asia’s accelerating internet economy is expected to
                grow to US$240 billion by 2025 (source: Google-Temasek e-conomy
                SEA Report 2018). The value of the region’s internet sector has
                surpassed the GDP of more than 100 countries globally in just
                the last three years, aided by an increasingly affluent rising
                middle class, growing urbanisation and a population that
                continues to rapidly adopt digital technologies, with 90% of
                internet users accessing the web with their smartphones.
                Investor confidence in Southeast Asia has also grown, with
                US$9.1 billion raised by the region’s tech sector in 1H2018
                comparable to the US$9.4 billion raised in the whole of 2017.
              </p>
              <p>
                Indonesia magnifies the opportunity set within Southeast Asia’s
                internet economy, not just because of population scale, but also
                because of headroom for technological penetration across
                multiple verticals. Ride hailing and online food delivery
                penetration today is estimated at 2-3% of population compared to
                over 14% in China, while the penetration of digital payments is
                still rather nascent at sub-1% compared to 15% in China.
              </p>
              <p>
                GOJEK has become a leading example of how technology companies
                can excel in this favourable growth environment. The below
