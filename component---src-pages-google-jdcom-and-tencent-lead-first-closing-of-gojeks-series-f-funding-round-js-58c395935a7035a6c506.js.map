The value of the region’s internet sector has\n                surpassed the GDP of more than 100 countries globally in just\n                the last three years, aided by an increasingly affluent rising\n                middle class, growing urbanisation and a population that\n                continues to rapidly adopt digital technologies, with 90% of\n                internet users accessing the web with their smartphones.\n                Investor confidence in Southeast Asia has also grown, with\n                US$9.1 billion raised by the region’s tech sector in 1H2018\n                comparable to the US$9.4 billion raised in the whole of 2017.\n              </p>\n              <p>\n                Indonesia magnifies the opportunity set within Southeast Asia’s\n                internet economy, not just because of population scale, but also\n                because of headroom for technological penetration across\n                multiple verticals. Ride hailing and online food delivery\n                penetration today is estimated at 2-3% of population compared to\n                over 14% in China, while the penetration of digital payments is\n                still rather nascent at sub-1% compared to 15% in China.\n              </p>\n              <p>\n                Gojek has become a leading example of how technology companies\n                can excel in this favourable growth environment.
