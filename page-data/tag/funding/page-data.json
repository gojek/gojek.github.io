This new investment will support\nGojek’s mission to boost Southeast Asia’s digital economy, with a focus on\nsupporting payments and financial services in the region.\n\nWith digital payments adoption primed to accelerate exponentially, the resources\nfrom some of the world’s leading global tech businesses will be combined with\nthe local focus and technology of Gojek.\n\nThis benefits millions of businesses and people across Indonesia and other parts\nof Southeast Asia.\n\nGojek’s payments business, GoPay, has long been focused on increasing access to\nthe digital economy among micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), the\nmajority of which continue to rely on cash to operate, due to the region’s large\nunbanked population. The latest influx of funding will support more of these\nbusinesses as they seek to digitise further, from micro-merchants selling wares\non the street side, up to large businesses looking to strengthen their digital\npayment infrastructure.\n\nSince launching its app in 2015, Gojek has digitised hundreds of thousands of\nmerchants on its platform, providing them with access to more than 170 million\nusers across Southeast Asia. Its payments business processes billions of\ntransactions each year and owns the largest e-wallet in Indonesia. A large part\nof this is driven by GoFood, the largest food delivery service in Indonesia, as\nwell as the expansion of GoPay into other sectors both within and outside the\nGojek ecosystem.\n\nGojek Co-CEO, Andre Soelistyo, said:\n\n> This is great validation that the world’s most innovative tech companies\nrecognise the positive impact Gojek is making in Indonesia and the whole of\nSoutheast Asia. By working together, we have the opportunity to achieve\nsomething truly unique as we aim to help more businesses to digitise and ensure\nthat many millions more consumers are enjoying the benefits that the digital\neconomy can bring.\n> The COVID-19 pandemic and its associated issues have served as a tough reminder\nthat if our economies are to be more resilient, they must be underpinned by\ndigital infrastructure that diversifies the ways in which people can live and\ntransact. We see our role as a convener of global tech expertise, facilitating\ncollaboration that will ultimately lead to a better future for everyone in our\nregion.\nGojek Co-CEO, Kevin Aluwi, added:\n\n> Since we were founded, the story of Gojek’s growth has been inexorably linked\nwith the growth of the micro-entrepreneurs and small businesses on our platform\nand this will always be the case. With some of the world’s best technology\ncompanies as partners, we are confident that we can continue to deliver unique\nworld-class products and services for the various players in our ecosystem.\nFacebook’s investment is the first it has made in an Indonesia-based business as\nit seeks to create new opportunities for businesses in the country, including\nthrough its ubiquitous Whatsapp service.\n\nMatt Idema, Chief Operating Officer at WhatsApp, said: “Gojek, WhatsApp and\nFacebook are indispensable services in Indonesia. Working together we can help\nbring millions of small businesses and the customers they serve into the largest\ndigital economy in Southeast Asia.”\n\nAs part of its commercial agreement, PayPal’s payment capabilities will be\nintegrated into Gojek’s services and the two companies will also collaborate to\nallow customers of GoPay, Gojek’s digital wallet, to gain access to PayPal’s\nnetwork of more than 25 million merchants around the world.\n\nFarhad Maleki, Head of Corporate Development and Ventures for APAC at PayPal,\nsaid: “Southeast Asia is at an inflection point in digital adoption that creates\nnew opportunities to deliver financial services to previously unbanked merchants\nand consumers. We could not be more excited about entering into this strategic\nrelationship with Gojek to expand access and provide new experiences for our\ncollective customers in this dynamic market and around the world.”\n\nGoogle and Tencent are longstanding investors in Gojek. Both companies have\ncollaborated on multiple Gojek projects since their first investments in 2018.\n\nCaesar Sengupta, VP, Payments and Next Billion Users, Google, said: “Gojek’s\ninnovation and technologies have had an incredible impact in making life more\nconvenient for Indonesians across the country and in bringing its MSMEs online.\nWe’re pleased to continue to invest in and enable Gojek in its journey. Gojek’s\nsuccess points to the strength of the region’s internet economy and the\ninnovation in its start-up ecosystem.”\n\nJeffrey Li, Vice President of Tencent Holdings and Managing Partner of Tencent\nInvestment, said, “Gojek is effectively promoting digitization and financially\nenabling small businesses. We’re glad to strengthen our partnership through the\nincreased investment and we look forward to further collaboration with Gojek.”\n\nAbout Gojek Group\nGojek is Southeast Asia’s leading technology group and a pioneer of the\nintegrated Super App and ecosystem model. Gojek is founded on the principle of\nusing technology to remove life’s daily frictions by connecting consumers to the\nbest providers of goods and services in the market.\n\nThe company was first established in 2010 focusing on courier and motorcycle\nride-hailing services, before launching the app in January 2015 in Indonesia.\nSince then, Gojek has grown to become the leading Super App in Southeast Asia,\nproviding access to a wide range of services from transportation and digital\npayments, to food delivery, logistics, and many other on-demand services.\n\nGojek now operates across 207 cities in five Southeast Asian countries.
