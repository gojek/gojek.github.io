The feeling of going to a big mall in an unfamiliar place,\ntrying to book a ride, but not knowing which is the most convenient pickup spot.\n\nDo I try the north entrance? Oh wait, there’s a one-way there, might need to\nwait a long while.\n\nAh, I got a driver but I don’t know how to tell her which side I am on. Wait,\nthere’s a Starbucks here. I’m in front of Starbucks!\n\nOh, you’re near McDonalds? Wait, maybe I can just come to you. But, how do I get\nto McDonalds now? ?‍♂️\n\n> Yeah, we’ve all been there.\nPickup points may seem like trivial things, but when you operate on a scale of\nmillions of orders per day, smoother pickups which require less coordination\n(and time) mean our customers get places faster, and our driver partners earn\nmore.\n\nIn this post, we’ll talk about how Gojek improved the pickup experience for\ncustomers and partners using Points of Interest (POI) — like a mall — and then\nstreamlined pickups around these areas using Pre-Defined Pickup Points (PPOI).\n\nThe Breakdown\nMany of the cities Gojek operates in are highly congested urban settings, where\nlocations are often not properly labelled on maps and pickup points can be hard\nto determine. This initially led to a lot of additional coordination between\npartners and customers over the phone, which is not the best use of anyone’s\ntime.\n\nIn order to streamline this process, we first began identifying POIs in popular\nareas. Once this was done, we located areas around these landmarks where lots of\npickups happened, and began suggesting them as pre-defined pickup points to our\nusers. Making these suggestions within the app was the first step in reducing\nthe cognitive load associated with pickups. (If you’d like to know how we\nidentified these spots. Check out this post\n[https://blog.gojekengineering.com/how-i-met-my-gojek-driver-without-a-single-call-95041f4fdd03]\n).\n\nOur next step in the process was to provide customers some details about the\nquality of these locations. We started showing them more details about the\npickup points near them—are they sheltered from weather, in case the driver\nneeds a couple of minutes to reach them? If it’s night, is it well-lit?\n\nBut wait, there’s more…\nPPOIs have contributed hugely to streamlining pickups and making life easier for\nour stakeholders. But what if the customer is new to an area and cannot easily\nidentify the locations we’re suggesting? Could we do more?\n\nOf course we could.\n\nUp until recently, pickup points showed up as map pins on the customer app based\non their location. We decided to add some additional functionality, starting\nwith images.\n\nIf you’re making a booking from an unfamiliar location, or have unreliable GPS\nconnectivity, how do you know you’re at the correct point suggested by the Gojek\napp? By adding images to the corresponding pins, we gave our customers the\nadvantage of being able to visually confirm they were in the right place.\n\nWith the two-factor confirmation of GPS pin and visual, our customers could\nconfirm their pickup point, and wait in peace. Not bad, eh?\n\nAt this point, our app could cater reliably to most of our users, whether it was\nregulars who already had a lot of context on ideal pickup spots or users who\nwere new to an area. However, we wanted to go even further to make a more\nairtight solution. What if a user was near a pickup point, but did not know how\nto reach it?\n\nThis was a problem with significant impact, as a user walking a short distance\nto a nearby well-served pickup point would be significantly faster than a driver\npartner navigating to an unfamiliar location nearby. Driver partners would\npotentially run into obstacles like one ways, or areas in Jakarta where odd-even\nrules are implemented.\n\nHowever, we didn’t want to put the onus of navigating to the PPOI on the user.\nThe least we could do in return for their cooperation was help them with\ndirections.\n\nSo that’s what we did.\n\nBeing able to leverage technology to help users book rides is an achievement in\nitself, one we’re proud of. But stopping at the solution is not how Super Apps\nare built. We exist to solve problems, and then delighting our users further\nthrough ease of use.\n\nFrom vague pickup points defined by often inaccurate GPS pings, our pickup\nexperience had evolved to the point where a user with zero knowledge of an area\ncould easily identify the best location nearby for smooth pickup, understand\nwhether it was convenient to wait at, navigate there, and confirm their arrival\nby sight. Utter delight. ?\n\nThat said, all our bookings don’t happen in dense urban areas with defined\nPPOIs. We’re working towards having PPOIs in most major areas, but sometimes,\ngood old chat-based coordination is still the default fallback.\n\nWe did learn a thing or two from our experience of putting images on PPOIs, so\nwe worked with Gojek’s Platform team (which handles our chat functionality), and\nbaked in the ability to share images in Driver-to-Customer chat. Even if all\nelse fails, our customers could still click a picture of their current location,\nand share it with our partners to help them identify it.\n\nIt’s safe to say that putting in the effort to help our customers get to their\nrides easily has paid off.\n\n> In the areas where we’ve deployed these features, we’ve seen pickup accuracy\ndouble on average. ✌\nWhat’s next?\nThere’s more?\n\nThere’s always more.\n\nEven as we continue to roll out this functionality across more regions we\noperate in, we’re working towards making it better—by allowing our users to give\nus feedback on how accurate our images/directions were, and even upload PPOI\nimages themselves.\n\nWe’ll keep you updated on how we fare.

Here’s\nwhat’s different:\n\nThere are two subtle changes — the colour of the button is a different shade of\ngreen and the elevation is also different.\n\nIn Asphalt\n[https://blog.gojekengineering.com/ux-engineering-at-gojek-9de2abe24928], our\ndesign language system, we want to make sure our UI components are robust and\ndetect breakages early. Here’s how we leveraged screenshot tests to achieve\nthis.\n\nComponents Everywhere\nAsphalt Components in Gojek appWith Asphalt, we create components that can be\nreused across the Gojek app. Every button, text, input, or card which you see in\nmost of the screens of the app is an Asphalt Component. On top of this, we have\na demo app which showcases the usage of these components.\n\nAsphalt Components in Demo appOur components are the backbone of the Gojek app\nUI. For example, our button class has 300+ occurrences across Gojek’s consumer\napp codebase. This heavy reuse helps us enforce design guidelines across the\napp. The importance of these components requires that we test them thoroughly,\nas even a small regression in one component could mean a degraded experience for\nour users.\n\n[U]n[I]t Testing\nUnit tests are supposed to test logic and fail when expectations aren’t met. How\ndo we expect that a certain UI is being rendered properly?\n\nThe idea of screenshot testing is to have a master copy of screenshots that we\nknow are correct and on every test run compare the current screenshots to the\nmaster copy. If the current set does not match the master set, the test fails.\nThis will allow us to check unintentional UI changes. If the changes are\nintentional, then we run the tests in update mode which updates the master\nscreenshots.\n\nHere is the high level outline:\n\n> - Write Espresso test for all activities in the demo\n> - Take screenshots and create a master set\n> - At every CI run take screenshots again and compare with master set\nWe started out with Shot [https://github.com/Karumi/Shot], an open source\nlibrary which allows us to take screenshots and compare them using gradle\ncommands and generate reports.\n\nHere’s what a test for our Alert component looks like 👇\n\nAchilles Heel — The Android Emulator\nWhile the Android emulator has improved a lot in recent times, we found running\nemulators in CI is still unreliable.\n\nHere are a few issues we faced:\n\n> - We had to wait to for the emulator to start up, which was only possible\nthrough a hack(y) script by continuously pinging adb commands\n> Emulator would put more memory pressure on CI runners\n> Emulators also need hardware acceleration which required us to enable kvm on our\nLinux-based machines.\nRunning Instrumentation test cases with these issues would mean our tests would\nbe flaky — and we couldn’t have that.\n\nFirebase Test Lab saves the day!\nWe decide to move away from emulators to real devices.\n\nOne idea was to have devices connected to a machine and use the machine as a\nrunner for running test cases in CI — a device test lab.\n\nBut devices come with their own baggage — maintaining them. They may be\ninterrupted by software updates, system dialogs… or get overcharged and explode!\n🔥\n\nWe found the next best thing: Firebase Test Lab\n[https://firebase.google.com/docs/test-lab] — a set of devices in cloud, managed\nautomatically and available via CLI.\n\nThis solved our device problem, but we ran into another one — Firebase Test Lab\ndoesn’t allow you to run custom gradle commands. Instead, it expects you to\nupload a debug and a test apk, and it will run the tests for you. This meant we\ncould no longer use Shot for taking screenshots and comparing them 😦\n\nWhile scratching our heads over how to overcome this problem, we found that\nFirebase Test Lab allows you\n[https://firebase.google.com/docs/test-lab/android/test-screenshots] to take\nscreenshots through a library and then retrieve them from Google Cloud Bucket.\n\nThere is also a gradle plugin [https://github.com/runningcode/fladle/] which\nautomates this process including downloading artifacts from GCP — open source to\nthe rescue again!\n\nHere’s how our test case looks like with Firebase screenshot library:\n\nFor image comparison we used ImageMagick [https://imagemagick.org/], a very\npopular and feature-packed CLI tool for image manipulation. It also allows us to\noutput a different image in case two images don’t match, which is super useful\nfor generating test failure reports.\n\nThe final piece — integrating screenshot tests into our developer workflow\nAs part of CI, we do the following things when a merge request is raised:\n\n> - Build the project\n> - Run Espresso Tests on Firebase Test Lab\n> - Retrieve screenshots and compare them with master set\n> - If any screenshot doesn’t match, we fail the build and add a comment to PR\nusing Danger [https://danger.systems/]\nDanger reporting mismatch in screenshot along with diff image.We have been using\nthis setup for some time now, and it’s worked out great for us! We have been\nable to execute multiple UI refactors with high confidence.\n\nWhat’s next?\nWe will continue to invest in this setup in the future. Things like testing\nlocalisation, having a test matrix with multiple screen sizes, API levels,\ndevice densities… these are some things we have planned for the future.\n\nA big thank you to the open source libraries that helped us achieve this!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLiked what you read?

We moved from an overwhelming single\npage with too much information, to a more intuitive two-step design with a hope\nthat the new design will help our users navigate the flow better (detailed in \npart two [http://bit.ly/2FUiYDo]).\n\nWe rolled out the design to beta on August 12, 2018.\n\nThis is what our redesigned flow looked like?\n\nOne week later:\nA 10% drop in our orders!!?\n\nThat… did not go according to plan. ?\n\nBut here’s the fun part: The app worked, and the bookings went through. No major\nout-of-whack tech issues. Yet, there we were, steadily losing orders.\n\nBugs? No.\n\nServer issues? Nope.\n\nDowntime, then? Nuh-uh.\n\nAfter many such questions and no answer, we were left with just one conclusion.\n?\n\nThe design change had made things worse.\n\nJust when I thought my job was done, I realised it was only the beginning. For I\nknew, no solution was good enough until users were successfully using it.\n\nStrap in, we’re in the Endgame now ?\nPrior to launch, we had rallied the team around a common definition of success —\none that was quantifiable and easily measured. 10% drop in our orders did seem\ntragic, but we knew looking at a single metric wasn’t going to give us the full\nstory.\n\nHence along with defining success metrics for our overall conversions, we also\ndefined and tracked metrics for the smaller tasks, tasks that led the user to\nthe final goal. This helped us monitor whether users were navigating through the\nflow as intended. As a designer it was important to not restrict myself to just\nwireframes and workflows, but participate and know these numbers inside out.\n\n“Designers who are involved in setting success metrics are far better at driving\nimpact than designers who are not”\n\n— Julie Zhuo\n\nFocusing on post launch productivity ?\nWhen the overall booking rate dropped, we started digging deeper to find where\nthe frictions were in the flow. We started sifting through the finer details and\nclosely analysed the smaller tasks, the results were a bit surprising.\n\n * By moving the location card to the top, our cancellation rate for wrong\n   address selected dropped by 2% —First win☝️\n * There was no significant drop in the notes or dishes added to the cart. Much\n   to our relief, the new interface was intuitive, users were able to locate the\n   notes button and other dish details— Second win ✌️\n * Similar affirmative results with our payments and location card designs too — \n   More wins! ?\n * But, there was one issue. Most users who abandoned the flow, left it on the\n   first step itself. Which meant nearly 8% of users did not even land on the\n   second step of the redesigned flow — Big Loss ?\n\nOur sanest conclusion was to wait, and give our users some time to get a hang of\nthe new designs. After all, old habits die hard. Thousands of our users who were\npreviously used to a single step now had to break a solid habit.\n\nYes, the old design was unacceptable (well, in the designer world at least ?).\nThe new design — despite featuring enhanced UX — broke some habits for our\nusers.\n\nA week passed… then two…\n\nNothing changed. ️\n\nAfter shuffling through tons of data, we found ourselves with a bunch of\nquestions. Who were the users who abandoned their food at checkout? What were\nthey thinking? Why would they do this?\n\nTo get these answered we coupled our quantitative data with some qualitative\nresearch — below are some crude user thoughts ?\n\nThere were two major problems:\n\n 1. Previously used to a single step, users weren’t prepared for a step 2.\n\n2. Most users added only 1–2 dishes, and for them the blank white space meant\nloading. Resulting in high uncertainty and agitation ?\n\nHence, most of them were reluctant to click on NEXT with the fear of placing the\norder — without them knowing the payment method or location ?\n\nWe were evidently drowning, but before we called for the lifebuoy, we tried to\nswim up ourselves. Not ready to give up on our precious designs, we decided to\nbring down the uncertainty by changing the copy on the button to Proceed To Pay.\nWe hoped this would nudge users to realise there is a step 2 containing payment\ninformation.\n\n\nThe Hail Mary play.Did it work? Did the uncertainty drop?\n\nMuch to our despair…nothing changed, no major impact. Neither were we able to\nbring down the booking time, nor were we able to increase the conversion rate.\nNot even close to what we anticipated.\n\nMurder your darlings ??\nWe had to be more open minded. If most of our users seemed unhappy with the\ndesign. we simply had to change it, Period ✋. It was time to hit the dashboards,\nanalyse the problems, and form new ideas for improvements. With the growing\nnumbers, one thing was clear, users wanted to bring back the single page.\n\nFor our final solution we shifted from logic to emotion, focusing more on user’s\nthoughts and feelings at the time of ordering.\n\nI asked myself, if I were a user and I had to know three things about my order,\nwhat would those be? ? — Card sorting came in super handy\n\n * Location Card — I want my food to come to me. I am hungry and the last thing\n   I want is my food going to someone else ?. With a drop in the cancellation\n   rate forwrong address selected, we knew retaining location card at the top\n   worked like magic.\n * Dish Card — If I am craving for a pizza, I better order the right pizza. \n   Right below the location card was the dish card, helping users easily double\n   check the dishes they added ?\n * Total amount and mode of payment — Once I get my pizza, I don’t want to run\n   around looking for cash. By sticking the total amount and payment method with\n   the order button at bottom of the screen, we saved our users a long scroll.\n   This also created a neat space to surface discounts and savings ?\n\nThe final design was a single page with all three important fields (location,\ndish and payment) above the fold and easily accessible. An example of how it\nworked ?\n\nThese lightweight and progressive changes, helped our users cultivate new habits\nslowly and steadily, making the redesign bearable for them ?\n\nShipping — Climbing back onto the boat ?‍♀️\nWe were finally ready to roll, no leap of faith this time!\n\nOn September 5, 2018. We rolled out our final solution to ~50k users, without\nrolling back any of the previous designs. We now had three designs live with\nthree different user groups.\n\n * Group 1 — Control Group (users with existing designs i.e. long scroll)\n * Group 2 — Two-step checkout redesign\n * Group 3 — Single step redesign\n\nSuch a meaty chance to dissect and compare quantitative results. ? It helped me\nstudy and analyse the impact of all three designs against each other.\n\nA day passed…\n\nThen two…\n\nThen a week or three later\n\nWe checked the data, ran the numbers, and validated our original hypothesis.\n\nIt had worked ?\n\nThe simplified single page was stabilising the order graph.

Wondering how we got here? \nHere’s the story so far: we were redesigning the checkout experience for Gojek’s\nfood delivery product — GoFood.\n\nWhy did we do a design change? Because nearly 20% of our customers abandoned\nfood in the cart at the ‘Checkout’ page. ?\n\nWhat’s the reason for that? There’s a dozen of them! Read the first piece in\nthis series for details on how we went about our research to understand users’\npain points.\n\n> Clearly, our original flow had issues. We had to change the structure to not\nonly support the complexity of the page, but also make it seem easier and\nintuitive to use.\nThis piece is about solutions. Our ephemeral moment of joy. ??\n\nOnce everyone understood the problems, it was time to point the team towards a\ncommon vision. We knew that the main issue sprung from the user needing to\nperform multiple actions and verifications — on a single page.\n\nTo illustrate, below are the five components chopped from our old checkout page\n(that required three scrolls to navigate through).\n\nNumerous iterations (in double digits if I had to recall the number), countless\npaper sketches, and feedback sessions followed. It took us another month to\nfinally find and roll out the solution. Safe to say we kept the proverbial\nmidnight oil burning.\n\nThe ideal solution, here we go.. ?\nAs described in the last post [http://bit.ly/2U8mm7s], we had identified five\ndistinct problems with our old Checkout flow that frustrated around 20% of users\nenough that they abandoned their order. For each one of the problems we\nidentified, we came up with a corresponding solution:\n\nSolution 1 — Simplify Information\n(Problem: Verbose Information)\n\nIt was time to be brutal and cut down on information density. We started off by\nasking a few questions:\n\nWhat goes with what? Do we really need this, or that? — This approach helped us\ngroup similar content and reduce visual complexity by combining or eliminating\ninformation altogether.\n\nHere’s an example. Our existing dish card consisted of the following components:\n\n * Dish Name\n * Dish Price\n * Stepper (number of dishes added)\n * Notes (added by the user)\n * Dish Description\n\nOur primary aim was to shrink the size of the card by removing or hiding\nredundant information and adding delight. It conjured up Maeda’s Principle of\nSimplicity — SHE. (Shrink, Hide, Embody).\n\nOur redesigned dish card was laid out like this:\n\n * Dish Name, Number (stepper) and Price: This is the minimum information a user\n   requires to confirm the dish in the cart to move forward. So we decided to\n   retain this as is.\n * Notes: There was a huge argument about this one — some said “let’s remove\n   notes entirely” while the others debated “ let’s do it at cart level rather\n   than having them per dish”. But our data said otherwise: 7 out of 10 dishes\n   ordered had notes added. This is very much a cultural nuance in Indonesia;\n   people order in groups and want their food customised to a point that\n   bewilders someone from the outside, like me. For example: while ordering the\n   traditional Padang — notes look like this: (1) ayam pop, rice with ayam pop\n   plus gulai soup plus rendang seasoning, no papaya leaves, more ayam pop\n   sauce, spicy pleaseeee, wrap it in one pack… because people there have\n   different preferences on the level of spiciness and packaging. Hence, we\n   decided to retain notes, but Hide it behind a 16 x 16 button which saved us\n   over a 100 pixels ?.\n\nThe redesigned notes section :)Dish Description: Technically users need the dish description before adding it\nto the cart (to get a sense of the taste, of course!). So, finding no use for it\nin the cart page, we considered removing it altogether. BUT, we didn’t want to\nbombard the user with too many changes in the redesign. Hence, we decided to S\nhrink and reveal only a portion of the description, retaining the rest behind a\nclick. (After a lot of trial and error, we decided on revealing 3 lines max —\nkeeping in mind various device sizes and our content quality).\n\n * Dish Images: Our conversion rates for dishes with images was way better than\n   dishes without images (6 out of 10 dishes ordered had images ??). To make\n   up for the missing notes and shrunken description, we took full advantage of\n   the saved real estate to bring in dish images on the checkout page, in order\n   to drive monetary growth (ordered dishes) and improve business metrics. Oh,\n   and obviously, add more delight for our users. ?Hence Embodying the dish\n   card.\n\nDish description redesigned :)We applied the same principle to payments, delivery, voucher & billing. \nObviously, we shifted through troves of data points for each of these ?. We\nmade a few radical changes, but without overwhelming the user.\n\nSolution 2 — Progressive Disclosure\n\n(Problem: Cognitive overload)\n\nOur aim here was for each component to be self evident, It was important to not\nonly simplify each section, but also reveal them in order of relevance. Rather\nthan throwing information at our users, we wanted to gracefully present it — to\nmaintain their attention by reducing clutter and confusion.\n\nThings that are related logically, are related visually.\n\nAfter a lot of arguments and brainstorming around user behaviour and device\nsizes, we locked down on the two-step checkout design — we divided the five\ncomponents from a single page into two different steps.\n\nThis was a huge shift in thinking, and was going to add an element of confusion\namong our loyal users. Instead of taking 100 actions on one page, our fall back\nwas to divide and conquer. A calculated leap of faith ?\n\nPage 1 — Check dishes, Cross selling & Total price (food-related information)\n\nPage 2 — How to pay and where to deliver (checkout-related information)\n\nThis improved usability by presenting only the minimum data required for the\ntask at hand. It also helped us achieve the following:\n\n * Bring down cognitive overload.\n * Ease decision making.\n * Free up real estate for business and monetisation (banners, up-selling).\n\nTwo-step checkout designSolution 3 — Bring down checkout time\n\n(Problem: Prolonged Checkout)\n\nWith a simplified structure of divided steps, our on-point hypothesis was: \nlesser time taken to checkout ⏳. However, a lot of us also argued that the extra\nstep might increase the time instead. So we double-checked our hypothesis with a\nquick usability test. Much to our relief, the two-step process showed positive\nsigns and was proved to be faster.\n\nclick-click over scroll-scroll-scroll-click.\n\nAnother small change that saved time was to make the CTA sticky on both the\nsteps, this saved users from scrolling all the way to the bottom to take the\nprimary action.\n\nSolution 4 — Reduce Cancellations\n(Problem: High Cancellations)\n\nOne big way to solve this was to bring our location card in focus, hence we\nfeatured it prominently at the top on the second step (refer to the image\nabove), and not hidden behind a scroll. This made it easy for the user to\nimmediately verify delivery location as soon as they landed on this page,\nreducing cancellations caused by an incorrect delivery address.\n\nSolution 5 — Ship delight\n(Problem: Lacks love)\n\nShipping delight was critical for GoFood. As a brand, we were known to be fun\nand colloquial — we wanted our designs to reflect this trait visually ❤️\n\nHere’s an example of how we did it:\n\nOur old designs used the native pop-up to throw an error every time a GoFood\nuser placed an order above our maximum distance limit (25 km). It needed some\nlove, as we were dealing with hungry (and sometimes, cranky) minds. We tried to\nmake this screen more fun and informative.\n\nWe gave our users an understanding of why we don’t do food delivery above 25 km,\nand added a delightful illustration that was relatable for people in Indonesia.\n\nThe above illustration depicts a very common (funny) occurrence on the streets\nof Indonesia. Ever tried asking for an address or direction there? Well, chances\nare, you will end up exactly where you started. Yeah, that happens a lot! ?\n\nSome more examples of sprinkling love ❤\n\n❤ Delight all the wayyyy ❤Designing for edge cases ?\n\nAnother important step (often forgotten by designers) under the redesign sparkle\nwas solving for edge cases. It helps us reinforce usability in our designs by\nensuring whatever the user is trying to do works.\n\n“Why can’t I place my food order? Why is the ORDER button disabled?”\n— From a user who added 3 pizzas to their shopping cart at around 8:45 pm and\nrevisited the cart at 9:30 pm to place the order.\n\nUnfortunately, the pizzeria shuts at 9 pm. But, there was no way for the user to\nknow that since she accessed the cart directly from the homepage. ?\n\nSolving for the maximum in the happy flow, we didn’t sweat on edge cases \ninitially, but now that we had fleshed out our designs, it was time to turn the\nspotlight on our beloved edge cases . This helped reduce drop offs due to\nuncertainty, and increase business by guiding the user through it.\n\nEdge Cases — The UnderdogsCollaborating with engineers ?‍?\n\nIt’s one thing to have solutions in static sketch files, and a whole different\nfeeling to see them in action. We provided the engineers with prototypes to help\nthem paint a better picture and make our solutions more believable. ?\n\nAnother efficient way we communicated design intent was to actually sit with\nengineers. We did frequent design QAs — this helped us execute the expected\nexperience and gave us the ultimate pleasure of seeing every working pixel\nmatching our sketches.\n\nReady to launch ?\nPHEW! DONE!!\n\nThe new design was finally ready to ship. We were super excited to hear what our\nusers thought and how much they like our new, redesigned Checkout flow. Pats on\nbacks for the amazing work, research, and collaboration.\n\nThis was our moment of truth. All the months of hard work summed up in this\n6-second GIF ?\n\n\nGoing to Beta ?\n\nBefore rolling out to our millions of users, as is practice, we launched a beta\nversion to about 50K users. This was a good size for us to understand how things\nwere shaping up, and if we needed to go back to the drawing board.\n\nThings seemed okay — not too good or bad, no major dropoffs, the conversion\ngraph looked stable.

Wondering how we got here? <strong><strong><em><em>Here’s the story so far:</em></em></strong></strong> we were redesigning the checkout experience for Gojek’s food delivery product — GoFood.</p><p><strong><strong>Why did we do a design change?</strong></strong> Because nearly 20% of our customers abandoned food in the cart at the ‘Checkout’ page. ?</p><p><strong><strong>What’s the reason for that? </strong></strong>There’s a dozen of them! Read the first piece in this series for details on how we went about our research to understand users’ pain points.</p><blockquote><em><em>Clearly, our original flow had issues. We had to change the structure to not only support the complexity of the page, but also make it seem easier and intuitive to use.</em></em></blockquote><p><strong><strong>This piece is about solutions. Our ephemeral moment of joy. </strong></strong>??</p><p>Once everyone understood the problems, it was time to point the team towards a common vision. We knew that the main issue sprung from the user needing to perform multiple actions and verifications — on a single page.</p><p>To illustrate, below are the five components chopped from our old checkout page (that required three scrolls to navigate through).</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-full\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/9621/1*oG0g_9vKuFvO3q59qk7Juw.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>Numerous iterations (in double digits if I had to recall the number), countless paper sketches, and feedback sessions followed. It took us another month to finally find and roll out the solution. Safe to say we kept the proverbial midnight oil burning.</p><h1 id=\"the-ideal-solution-here-we-go-\">The ideal solution, here we go.. ?</h1><p>As described in <a href=\"http://bit.ly/2U8mm7s\" rel=\"noopener\">the last post</a>, we had identified five distinct problems with our old Checkout flow that frustrated around 20% of users enough that they abandoned their order. For each one of the problems we identified, we came up with a corresponding solution:</p><h2 id=\"solution-1-simplify-information\">Solution 1 — Simplify Information</h2><p><em><em>(Problem: Verbose Information)</em></em></p><p>It was time to be brutal and cut down on information density. We started off by asking a few questions:</p><p><strong><strong><em><em>What goes with what? Do we really need this, or that? </em></em></strong></strong><em><em>— </em></em>This approach helped us group similar content<em><em> </em></em>and reduce visual complexity by combining or eliminating information altogether.</p><p>Here’s an example. Our existing dish card consisted of the following components:</p><ul><li>Dish Name</li><li>Dish Price</li><li>Stepper (number of dishes added)</li><li>Notes (added by the user)</li><li>Dish Description</li></ul><p><em><em>Our primary aim was to shrink the size of the card by removing or hiding redundant information and adding delight. It conjured up <strong><strong>Maeda’s Principle of Simplicity — SHE</strong></strong>. (<strong><strong>S</strong></strong>hrink, <strong><strong>H</strong></strong>ide, <strong><strong>E</strong></strong>mbody).</em></em></p><p>Our redesigned dish card was laid out like this:</p><ul><li><strong><strong>Dish Name, Number (stepper) and Price:</strong></strong><em><em> </em></em>This is the minimum information a user requires to confirm the dish in the cart to move forward. So we decided to retain this as is.</li><li><strong><strong>Notes: </strong></strong>There was a huge argument about this one — some said <em><em>“let’s remove notes entirely” </em></em>while the others debated<em><em> “ let’s do it at cart level rather than having them per dish”.</em></em> But our <strong><strong>data said otherwise: 7 out of 10 dishes ordered had notes added</strong></strong>. This is very much a cultural nuance in Indonesia; people order in groups and want their food customised to a point that bewilders someone from the outside, like me. For example: while ordering the traditional Padang — <strong><strong>notes look like this: (1) ayam pop, rice with ayam pop plus gulai soup plus rendang seasoning, no papaya leaves, more ayam pop sauce, spicy pleaseeee, wrap it in one pack</strong></strong>… because people there have different preferences on the level of spiciness and packaging. Hence, we decided to retain notes, but <strong><strong>H</strong></strong>ide it behind a 16 x 16 button which saved us over a 100 pixels ?.</li></ul><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/2560/1*lxRyLn7OhauJt-o1wF9YNA.png\" class=\"kg-image\"><figcaption>The redesigned notes section :)</figcaption></figure><p><strong><strong>Dish Description:</strong></strong><em><em> </em></em>Technically<em><em> </em></em>users need the dish description <em><em>before</em></em> adding it to the cart (to get a sense of the taste, of course!). So, finding no use for it in the cart page, we considered removing it altogether. BUT, we didn’t want to bombard the user with too many changes in the redesign. Hence, we decided to <strong><strong>S</strong></strong>hrink and reveal only a portion of the description, retaining the rest behind a click. (A<em><em>fter a lot of trial and error, we decided on revealing 3 lines max — keeping in mind various device sizes and our content quality</em></em>).</p><ul><li><strong><strong>Dish Images: </strong></strong>Our conversion rates for dishes with images was way better than dishes without images (<em><em>6 out of 10 dishes ordered had images </em></em>??). To make up for the missing notes and shrunken description, we took full advantage of the saved real estate to bring in dish images on the checkout page, in order to drive monetary growth (ordered dishes) and improve business metrics. Oh, and obviously, add more delight for our users. ?Hence<strong><strong> E</strong></strong>mbodying the dish card.</li></ul><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/8192/1*XD1Up4ZPcOBfcAI4hjgBjQ.png\" class=\"kg-image\"><figcaption>Dish description redesigned :)</figcaption></figure><p>We applied the same principle to <strong><strong>payments, delivery, voucher &amp; billing. </strong></strong>Obviously, we shifted through troves of data points for each of these ?. We made a few radical changes, but without overwhelming the user.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/3832/1*XGfs2FbfyIYgmqU548uCtA.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>Solution 2 — Progressive Disclosure</p><p><em><em>(Problem: Cognitive overload)</em></em></p><p>Our aim here was for each component to be self evident, It was important to not only simplify each section, but also reveal them in order of relevance. Rather than throwing information at our users, we wanted to gracefully <em><em>present </em></em>it — to maintain their attention by reducing clutter and confusion.</p><p>Things that are related logically, are related visually.</p><p>After a lot of arguments and brainstorming around user behaviour and device sizes, we locked down on the <strong><strong>two-step checkout design</strong></strong> — we divided the five components from a single page into two different steps.</p><p>This was a huge shift in thinking, and was going to add an element of confusion among our loyal users. Instead of taking 100 actions on one page, our fall back was to divide and conquer. A calculated leap of faith ?</p><p><em><em><strong><strong>Page 1 </strong></strong>— Check dishes, Cross selling &amp; Total price (food-related information)</em></em></p><p><em><em><strong><strong>Page 2</strong></strong> — How to pay and where to deliver (checkout-related information)</em></em></p><p>This improved usability by presenting only the minimum data required for the task at hand. It also helped us achieve the following:</p><ul><li>Bring down cognitive overload.</li><li>Ease decision making.</li><li>Free up real estate for business and monetisation (banners, up-selling).</li></ul><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1646/1*CNqM5aQ_WM9on7xL1KJ3bQ.png\" class=\"kg-image\"><figcaption>Two-step checkout design</figcaption></figure><p>Solution 3 — Bring down checkout time</p><p><em><em>(Problem: Prolonged Checkout)</em></em></p><p>With a simplified structure of divided steps, our on-point hypothesis was: <strong><strong>lesser time taken to checkout ⏳</strong></strong>. However, a lot of us also argued that the extra step might increase the time instead. So we double-checked our hypothesis with a quick usability test. Much to our relief, the two-step process showed positive signs and was proved to be faster.</p><p><strong><strong><em><em>click-click </em></em></strong></strong>over<strong><strong><em><em> scroll-scroll-scroll-click.</em></em></strong></strong></p><p>Another small change that saved time was to make the CTA sticky on both the steps, this saved users from scrolling all the way to the bottom to take the primary action.</p><h2 id=\"solution-4-reduce-cancellations\">Solution 4 — Reduce Cancellations</h2><p><em><em>(Problem: High Cancellations)</em></em></p><p>One big way to solve this was to bring our location card in focus, hence we featured it prominently at the top on the second step (refer to the image above), and not hidden behind a scroll. This made it easy for the user to immediately verify delivery location as soon as they landed on this page, reducing cancellations caused by an incorrect delivery address.</p><h2 id=\"solution-5-ship-delight\">Solution 5 — Ship delight</h2><p><em><em>(Problem: Lacks love)</em></em></p><p>Shipping delight was critical for GoFood. As a brand, we were known to be fun and colloquial — we wanted our designs to reflect this trait visually ❤️</p><p>Here’s an example of how we did it:</p><p><strong><strong>Our old designs</strong></strong> used the native pop-up to throw an error every time a GoFood user placed an order above our maximum distance limit (25 km). It needed some love, as we were dealing with hungry (and sometimes, cranky) minds. We tried to make this screen more fun and informative.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1775/1*DKNTiA926KjyJyhR2rNPwQ.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>We gave our users an understanding of why we don’t do food delivery above 25 km, and added a delightful illustration that was relatable for people in Indonesia.</p><p>The above illustration depicts a very common (funny) occurrence on the streets of Indonesia. Ever tried asking for an address or direction there? Well, chances are, you will end up exactly where you started. Yeah, that happens a lot! ?</p><p>Some more examples of sprinkling love ❤</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/4070/1*RJJw-wTDJMfrKJdndgsY_w.png\" class=\"kg-image\"><figcaption>❤ Delight all the wayyyy ❤</figcaption></figure><p>Designing for edge cases ?</p><p>Another important step (often forgotten by designers) under the redesign sparkle was solving for edge cases. It helps us reinforce usability in our designs by ensuring whatever the user is trying to do works.</p><p><em><em><em>“Why can’t I place my food order? Why is the ORDER button disabled?”</em></em></em><br><em><em>— From a user who added 3 pizzas to their shopping cart at around 8:45 pm and revisited the cart at 9:30 pm to place the order.</em></em></p><p>Unfortunately, the pizzeria shuts at 9 pm. But, there was no way for the user to know that since she accessed the cart directly from the homepage. ?</p><p>Solving for the maximum in the happy flow, we didn’t sweat on <strong><strong>edge cases </strong></strong>initially, but now that we had fleshed out our designs, it was time to turn the spotlight on our beloved edge cases . This helped reduce drop offs due to uncertainty, and increase business by guiding the user through it.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/2869/1*4yrjldadvKavC9mA0V9-wQ.png\" class=\"kg-image\"><figcaption>Edge Cases — The Underdogs</figcaption></figure><p>Collaborating with engineers ?‍?</p><p>It’s one thing to have solutions in static sketch files, and a whole different feeling to see them in action. We provided the engineers with prototypes to help them paint a better picture and make our solutions more believable. ?</p><p>Another efficient way we communicated design intent was to actually sit with engineers. We did frequent design QAs — this helped us execute the expected experience and gave us the ultimate pleasure of seeing every working pixel matching our sketches.</p><h1 id=\"ready-to-launch-\">Ready to launch ?</h1><p>PHEW! DONE!!</p><p>The new design was finally ready to ship. We were super excited to hear what our users thought and how much they like our new, redesigned Checkout flow.

The largest food delivery service in\nSoutheast Asia, 300,000+ merchants, 16 million menu items… you get the drift.\nWith figures like that, you’d expect the GoFood user experience to be the best\nin the business.\n\nWhy then, did nearly 20% of GoFood users leave the checkout flow after adding\nitems to their cart?\n\nSomething wasn’t adding up.\n\nOur user flow was broken, and we needed to fix it.\n\nTL;DR: This post is part one of a three-part series highlighting the case study\nand critical considerations that went into redesigning the Checkout experience\nfor GoFood — Gojek’s food delivery product.\n\nLights, Camera… 💡🎥\nGOJEK was going through a major facelift in 2018. For a Super App with 19+\nproducts, we had all the scale-related issues one could imagine. We desperately\nneeded an efficient system for our designers and developers. This gave birth to \nAsphalt — GOJEK’s very own Design Language System [http://asphalt.gojek.io/].\n\nThe redesign started with our transport app — GoRide. It was then time to show\nsome love to Gojek’s prodigal child — GoFood. The product owner walked up to to\nme and said — “Let’s go beyond just the UI, and rethink the entire user\nexperience, instead of ceding over features as is.”\n\nWhat he meant — “Get ready! Lots of sleepless nights coming your way. We’re\ngoing to do a mammoth redesign, the likes of which minions like you will crumble\nunder.” ?\n\n🎬 Action!\nWe wanted our redesign to solve problems with specific business constraints, and\nwe knew it was impossible to do so without delving into user problems first.\n\nFinding the right problem to solve is harder (and more important) than finding\nthe right solution.\n\nFirst comes the framework\nTo achieve this, we pinned some critical thumb-rules before embarking on our\nredesign journey:\n\n * To be data-driven. (“Design is not about making things pretty” — I’m going to\n   parrot this line 10 times over in this blog and if you ever talk to me😅)\n * To incorporate the existing brand perception into all designs. (Marketing\n   says fun and creative but product looks dull and boring?Problem!)\n * To empathise with users and business requirements. (Always chase the full\n   story, be user-centric and business-driven)\n\nTo put the framework to use, we started white-boarding our in-app user flow. In\nthe journey graph, we noticed a large number of users were dropping-off at our\ncheckout page. That means nearly 20% of our users who added items to their cart,\nleft the flow right before placing the order (the last step) — the checkout page\n\nWe summed up the results to visually represent the emotional state of our in-app\nuser journey.Understand users’ pain points 😩\nThe second step was to understand our users’ pain points with the existing UX in\nthe checkout flow. To dig deeper into this, we reached out to our users directly\n(kudos to the research team for setting this up). We adapted both qualitative\nand quantitative methods to get to the root of every problem in the picture. We\nthen accumulated all our learnings into a consumer journey infographic.\n\nUser journey map | Courtesy: GoFood research team :)We wanted to involve the\nwhole GoFood team, beyond just research and design. This made it more\ncollaborative than the traditional sharing and feedback loop. To reinforce this,\nwe conducted several internal sharing and brainstorming sessions. The research\nteam also put together a fun quiz for user personas.\n\nInternal brainstorming sessions — Researchers, Engineers, Designers, PMs & UX\nwriters.What were the results?\n\nAs anticipated, our users felt agitated, confused and overwhelmed, resulting in\na big drop off at the Checkout page. Here’s some of the feedback from our users:\n\n“I find this step too confusing.”\n\n“A lot of times my order button is disabled (grey) and I don’t know why.”\n\n“I often miss rechecking some information at this step, most times I only focus\non payment.”\n\nThis entire process was important for us — to be able to go to the field, do\ninterviews, research, and speak to our customers directly. It gave us tremendous\ninsight into the product development, and is precisely what made our product so\ngood. This was not only fun but extremely useful.\n\nWith all the research and data at our disposal; we realised that redesigning the\ncheckout flow first will not only enhance the user experience, but help solve a\ncritical business problem.\n\n\nNeeds a lot of ❤, doesn’t it?The original page consists of five components on one single page. It was\nextremely overwhelming for most of our users:\n\n 1. Dish Details and Notes card\n\n2. Delivery Location Selection card\n\n3. Payment Method Selection card\n\n4. Voucher card\n\n5. Billing & Discounts card\n\nHats off to our users for being patient. I say this because every time a user\nlands on this page, they had to process a verbose set of information, and\nperform countless actions in a single page to just ‘confirm’ one food order.\nPainful. ?\n\nDesign is integral. Design is sacrosanct. While companies are now paying heed to\nthe importance of design, GOJEK, by virtue of being a #SuperApp, had to imbibe\ndesign logic into its very fabric.\n\nSo we got to work.\n\nDefining each problem ⚡️\nOnce we dissected the users’ goals and pain points, we had a clear picture of\nall the problems that plagued the Checkout flow. We narrowed our learnings to \nfive primary user problems to form a common understanding of what we were trying\nto solve.\n\nProblem 1: Verbose Information\nThe first thing most users did on this page was scroll, scroll and scroll. 3\nscrolls minimum. Also, did you notice the amount of text? We’re in the age of\nmicro-blogging and us millennials have the attention span of goldfishes, for\ncrying out loud!\n\nProblem 2: Cognitive overload\nThe page was overflowing with tasks that required explicit actions from the\nuser. Do this. And that. And hey, this too. Oh wait, THAT TOO. Chaotic. Select\ndelivery location but first find where it is, check the total, select payment\nmethod, glance through all the dishes added to the cart, apply your discount\nvoucher….?\n\nProblem 3: Prolonged Checkout\nToo many actions and redundant information caused users to spend more than 2\nminutes just to confirm and place a simple order. Time wasted, energy wasted,\ntummy still not fed. 😫\n\nProblem 4: High Cancellations\nA large sum of our users hurried through this step without actually\ndouble-checking delivery location details (buried under a scroll somewhere).\nThis resulted in nearly 3% of our users cancelling and reordering the same cart\nwith an updated address (that’s another story in itself).\n\nProblem 5: Lacks Love\nThere was nothing delightful about this page. The dishes didn’t have images on\ncheckout, the icons weren’t consistent, and had too much clutter. It was just\ntext and buttons stacked in the form of black and white cards. No, seriously,\neven the active ‘Add more items’ button was a plain grey.\n\nIn a nutshell, our flow lacked information hierarchy, delight, structure, was\ntoo complex, and in all… poor.\n\nIn order to fix this, we spent a month researching, ideating, and defining the\nproblem. Then we ideated some more, deliberated, chugged way too much beer (to\nadd some philosophical thinking), and tried to justify one solution after\nanother with the right data and metrics.\n\nWe were ready. We had all the answers. ?‍🤦‍♀️\n\n> Boy, were we wrong.\nIn the next post [http://bit.ly/2FUiYDo], I’ll detail all the steps we took to\narrive at this perfect (lol) solution — and how it all went downhill.\n\nWorking at GOJEK is an exercise in learning from experience. Sometimes, we find\nourselves confronted with undocumented and unsolved problems — which are\nexpected when building a Super App. We could use a hand in solving these\nproblems though.

The research team also put together a fun quiz for user personas.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/2856/1*lyqCBZNfBuBOUsUVFUo3-g.png\" class=\"kg-image\"><figcaption>Internal brainstorming sessions — Researchers, Engineers, Designers, PMs &amp; UX writers.</figcaption></figure><p>What were the results?</p><p>As anticipated, our users felt agitated, confused and overwhelmed, resulting in a big drop off at the Checkout page. Here’s some of the feedback from our users:</p><p><strong><strong><em><em>“I find this step too confusing.”</em></em></strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong><em><em>“A lot of times my order button is disabled (grey) and I don’t know why.”</em></em></strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong><em><em>“I often miss rechecking some information at this step, most times I only focus on payment.”</em></em></strong></strong></p><p><em><em>This entire process was important for us — to be able to go to the field, do interviews, research, and speak to our customers directly. It gave us tremendous insight into the product development, and is precisely what made our product so good. This was not only fun but extremely useful.</em></em></p><p>With all the research and data at our disposal; we realised that redesigning the checkout flow first will not only enhance the user experience, but help solve a critical business problem.<br></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/3278/1*T8b-QbwwRfMeWK14MOyKmg.png\" class=\"kg-image\"><figcaption>Needs a lot of ❤, doesn’t it?</figcaption></figure><p>The original page consists of <strong><strong><em><em>five</em></em></strong></strong> components on one <strong><strong><em><em>single</em></em></strong></strong> page. It was extremely overwhelming for most of our users:</p><ol><li>Dish Details and Notes card</li></ol><p>2. Delivery Location Selection card</p><p>3. Payment Method Selection card</p><p>4. Voucher card</p><p>5. Billing &amp; Discounts card</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-full\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/9621/1*X50izz9abnZyu81K55q_zA.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>Hats off to our users for being patient. I say this because every time a user lands on this page, they had to process a verbose set of information, and perform countless actions<strong><strong><em><em> in a single page </em></em></strong></strong>to just <em><em>‘confirm’</em></em> one food order. Painful. ?</p><p><em><em>Design is integral. Design is sacrosanct. While companies are now paying heed to the importance of design, GOJEK, by virtue of being a #SuperApp, had to imbibe design logic into its very fabric.</em></em></p><p>So we got to work.</p><h1 id=\"defining-each-problem-\">Defining each problem ⚡️</h1><p>Once we dissected the users’ goals and pain points, we had a clear picture of all the problems that plagued the Checkout flow. We narrowed our learnings to <strong><strong><em><em>five</em></em></strong></strong> primary user problems to form a common understanding of what we were trying to solve.</p><h2 id=\"problem-1-verbose-information\">Problem 1: Verbose Information</h2><p>The first thing most users did on this page was <em><em>scroll, scroll and scroll</em></em>. <strong><strong><em><em>3 scrolls minimum</em></em>. </strong></strong>Also, did you notice the amount of text? We’re in the age of micro-blogging and us millennials have the attention span of goldfishes, for crying out loud!</p><h2 id=\"problem-2-cognitive-overload\">Problem 2: Cognitive overload</h2><p>The page was overflowing with tasks that required explicit actions from the user. Do this. And that. And hey, this too. Oh wait, THAT TOO. Chaotic. Select delivery location but first find where it is, check the total, select payment method, glance through all the dishes added to the cart, apply your discount voucher….?</p><h2 id=\"problem-3-prolonged-checkout\">Problem 3: Prolonged Checkout</h2><p>Too many actions and redundant information caused users to spend more than <strong><strong><em><em>2 minutes</em></em></strong></strong> just to confirm and place a simple order. Time wasted, energy wasted, tummy still not fed. 😫</p><h2 id=\"problem-4-high-cancellations\">Problem 4: High Cancellations</h2><p>A large sum of our users hurried through this step without actually double-checking delivery location details (<em><em>buried under a scroll somewhere</em></em>). This resulted in nearly 3% of our users cancelling and reordering the same cart with an updated address (that’s another story in itself).</p><h2 id=\"problem-5-lacks-love\">Problem 5: Lacks Love</h2><p>There was nothing delightful about this page. The dishes didn’t have images on checkout, the icons weren’t consistent, and had too much clutter. It was just text and buttons stacked in the form of black and white cards. No, seriously, even the active ‘<em><em>Add more items’ </em></em>button was a plain grey.</p><p><em><em>In a nutshell<strong><strong>,</strong></strong> our flow lacked information hierarchy, delight, structure, was too complex, and in all… poor.</em></em></p><p>In order to fix this, we spent a month researching, ideating, and defining the problem. Then we ideated some more, deliberated, chugged way too much beer (to add some philosophical thinking), and tried to justify one solution after another with the right data and metrics.</p><p>We were ready. We had all the answers. ?‍🤦‍♀️</p><blockquote>Boy, were we wrong.</blockquote><p>In the <a href=\"http://bit.ly/2FUiYDo\" rel=\"noopener\">next post</a>, I’ll detail all the steps we took to arrive at this perfect <em><em>(lol) </em></em>solution — and how it all went downhill.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://gojek-ghost.zysk.in/content/images/2020/05/1_Yigf1nGxRKjzV7vIC_YkYg-4.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>Working at GOJEK is an exercise in learning from experience.
