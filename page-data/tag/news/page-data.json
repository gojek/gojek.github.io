Nadiem, Andre and Kevin have been\nrunning the business together for a number of years, which will ensure that this\nleadership transition will run smoothly.\n\nNadiem’s news was communicated in an email to all Gojek staff that was sent\ntoday. In the email, he looked back on how the company has grown over the past\nnine years and also set out his hopes for the future of the business:\n\n“We started this company with nothing, other than a deep desire to change things\nfor the better. We saw that the streets of Jakarta were a mess and that there\nwas an informal community of ojek drivers who could easily act as a huge part of\nthe solution to that mess, if only they were organised and working efficiently.\n\n“With just that initial desire to improve life for everyone, as well as a large\namount of support from countless friends, partners and stakeholders, we’ve\ncreated Gojek. An iconic company that flies the flag for the future of Indonesia\nand Southeast Asia.\n\n“I will leave Gojek in the capable hands of Andre Soelistyo and Kevin Aluwi as\nco-CEOs, both of whom have played central roles in moving the company along its\npath from that office in South Jakarta onto the global stage.\n\n“We got very lucky as we progressed along that path, but I believe that luck in\nbusiness only really becomes a valuable commodity if you have the brilliant\nminds needed to take advantage of it. Kevin and Andre have mentored me to be the\nleader I am today. They are quite simply Gojek’s best. They have been running\nthis company for a number of years and I have complete faith not just in their\ntechnical skills and ability to execute flawlessly, but also in their integrity\nand their desire to do the right thing every step of the way.\n\n“High emotions are involved in running a company like Gojek but Andre and Kevin\nare always the steady voices of reason, approaching problems with intelligence\nand compassion. I couldn’t ask for better successors as the Gojek movement\nbegins its next stage of growth.”\n\nA joint statement released by Andre and Kevin said: “When a friend and mentor\nleaves a business you have built together, there is always going to be some\nsadness, but we are both determined that Gojek will go from strength to\nstrength. We will continue to implement our vision as we focus on what the Gojek\nof the next ten years is going to be like.\n\n“This company has changed the lives of so many people in Indonesia and around\nthe region, and our key priority is to ensure that we can continue to act as a\npositive force in society for the foreseeable future.”\n\nUnder Andre and Kevin’s management, Gojek has grown exponentially, to process\nover two billion transactions a year. The company’s fundraising efforts have\nattracted some of the world’s most exciting companies including Google, Tencent,\nMitsubishi, Visa, AIA and Astra, with Series F set to raise well over US$2bn.\nThe company has also launched operations in Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam,\nwhile the Gojek app has become the most-used on-demand application in Indonesia,\nwhere its food and payments businesses have overtaken transport to become the\nlargest businesses within the group.\n\nWith the new structure, Andre will focus on corporate functions and management\nof capital allocation, international expansion as well as the payments and\nfinancial services businesses, while Kevin will focus on the product development\nelements of the Gojek business as well as marketing, organisational development\nand the transportation and food delivery businesses.\n\nSince co-founding Gojek, Kevin has held significant leadership roles across\nproduct and functional teams within the organisation. He has used his background\nin Business Intelligence to pioneer the use of data for decision-making across\nthe Gojek business. He has also assembled deep technology expertise across the\ndata, engineering and product teams, with a focus on enhancing the platform’s\noverall user experience. Prior to his role at Gojek, Kevin spent time at Zalora\nIndonesia, Merah Putih Incubator and Salem Partners.\n\nSimilarly, Andre has played a pivotal role in laying a solid foundation for\nGojek’s rapid growth. He has overseen over US$4bn of fundraising, which\nattracted key investors such as Google, Tencent, Astra, KKR and Warburg Pincus.\nHe has also laid the foundation for the company’s business strategy for long\nterm sustainability. Prior to joining Gojek, Andre was an Executive Director at\nNorthstar Group — Indonesia’s largest private equity fund, and was previously\nthe Head of Corporate Finance at Delta Dunia Makmur.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLeading the next phase of Gojek — a statement from Gojek Co-CEOs, Kevin Aluwi\nand Andre Soelistyo\nGojek’s new co-CEOs Kevin Aluwi and Andre Soelistyo have today released a\nstatement following the announcement that Founder Nadiem Makarim has accepted a\nposition in President Joko Widodo’s new cabinet.\n\nAndre and Kevin have been running the business along with Nadiem, for a number\nof years, which will ensure a smooth leadership transition. In addition, it has\ntoday been revealed that Gojek commissioner Garibaldi Thohir will become\nPresident Commissioner to lead the company’s non-executive board.

We are very proud and honored that our founder\nwill move on to create impact at a larger scale, benefiting the whole nation.\n\n“Nadiem leaves after an amazing nine years spent building the company from just\nan idea, into a multi-billion dollar business that reduces friction in the lives\nof people throughout Southeast Asia, while providing a source of income for\nmillions. His achievements have been a source of inspiration to everyone at\nGojek and he leaves the business at a time when there’s never been more\nexcitement about its future potential. We now have over two million driver\npartners across Southeast Asia and over 500,000 merchants, all of whom together\nprocess over two billion transactions annually.\n\n“Both of us have been running the Gojek business alongside Nadiem for some time,\nso there will be no disruption to the day to day operations or the amazing\ngrowth we have enjoyed over the years. Andre will focus on corporate functions\nand management of capital allocation, international expansion as well as\npayments and financial services, while Kevin will focus on the product\ndevelopment elements of the Gojek business as well as marketing, organisational\ndevelopment and the transportation and food delivery businesses.\n\n“We are well prepared for the future and this is due in large part to the many\noutstanding industry leaders that have joined us over the past few years, and\nthe collective vision and execution of the entire Gojek team.\n\n“We would like to conclude by thanking the government of Indonesia for\nrecognising the significance our business has had on society. We will respect\nthe process the Palace has set out by not going into too much detail before\ntomorrow’s inauguration. We would also like to wish Nadiem the very best of luck\nas he embarks on this very important mission.”\n\nSince co-founding Gojek, Kevin has held significant leadership roles across\nproduct and functional teams within the organisation.

We couldn’t\nbe more optimistic about the company’s future and its continued positive impact\nto Indonesia’s economy and society.

We saw that the streets of Jakarta were a mess and that there was an informal community of ojek drivers who could easily act as a huge part of the solution to that mess, if only they were organised and working efficiently.</em></em></p><p><em><em>“With just that initial desire to improve life for everyone, as well as a large amount of support from countless friends, partners and stakeholders, we’ve created Gojek. An iconic company that flies the flag for the future of Indonesia and Southeast Asia.</em></em></p><p><em><em>“I will leave Gojek in the capable hands of Andre Soelistyo and Kevin Aluwi as co-CEOs, both of whom have played central roles in moving the company along its path from that office in South Jakarta onto the global stage.</em></em></p><p><em><em>“We got very lucky as we progressed along that path, but I believe that luck in business only really becomes a valuable commodity if you have the brilliant minds needed to take advantage of it. Kevin and Andre have mentored me to be the leader I am today. They are quite simply Gojek’s best. They have been running this company for a number of years and I have complete faith not just in their technical skills and ability to execute flawlessly, but also in their integrity and their desire to do the right thing every step of the way.</em></em></p><p><em><em>“High emotions are involved in running a company like Gojek but Andre and Kevin are always the steady voices of reason, approaching problems with intelligence and compassion. I couldn’t ask for better successors as the Gojek movement begins its next stage of growth.”</em></em></p><p>A joint statement released by Andre and Kevin said: “When a friend and mentor leaves a business you have built together, there is always going to be some sadness, but we are both determined that Gojek will go from strength to strength. We will continue to implement our vision as we focus on what the Gojek of the next ten years is going to be like.</p><p>“This company has changed the lives of so many people in Indonesia and around the region, and our key priority is to ensure that we can continue to act as a positive force in society for the foreseeable future.”</p><p>Under Andre and Kevin’s management, Gojek has grown exponentially, to process over two billion transactions a year. The company’s fundraising efforts have attracted some of the world’s most exciting companies including Google, Tencent, Mitsubishi, Visa, AIA and Astra, with Series F set to raise well over US$2bn. The company has also launched operations in Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam, while the Gojek app has become the most-used on-demand application in Indonesia, where its food and payments businesses have overtaken transport to become the largest businesses within the group.</p><p>With the new structure, Andre will focus on corporate functions and management of capital allocation, international expansion as well as the payments and financial services businesses, while Kevin will focus on the product development elements of the Gojek business as well as marketing, organisational development and the transportation and food delivery businesses.</p><p>Since co-founding Gojek, Kevin has held significant leadership roles across product and functional teams within the organisation. He has used his background in Business Intelligence to pioneer the use of data for decision-making across the Gojek business. He has also assembled deep technology expertise across the data, engineering and product teams, with a focus on enhancing the platform’s overall user experience. Prior to his role at Gojek, Kevin spent time at Zalora Indonesia, Merah Putih Incubator and Salem Partners.</p><p>Similarly, Andre has played a pivotal role in laying a solid foundation for Gojek’s rapid growth. He has overseen over US$4bn of fundraising, which attracted key investors such as Google, Tencent, Astra, KKR and Warburg Pincus. He has also laid the foundation for the company’s business strategy for long term sustainability. Prior to joining Gojek, Andre was an Executive Director at Northstar Group — Indonesia’s largest private equity fund, and was previously the Head of Corporate Finance at Delta Dunia Makmur.</p><hr><h1 id=\"leading-the-next-phase-of-gojek-a-statement-from-gojek-co-ceos-kevin-aluwi-and-andre-soelistyo\"><strong>Leading the next phase of Gojek — a statement from Gojek Co-CEOs, Kevin Aluwi and Andre Soelistyo</strong></h1><p>Gojek’s new co-CEOs Kevin Aluwi and Andre Soelistyo have today released a statement following the announcement that Founder Nadiem Makarim has accepted a position in President Joko Widodo’s new cabinet.</p><p>Andre and Kevin have been running the business along with Nadiem, for a number of years, which will ensure a smooth leadership transition. In addition, it has today been revealed that Gojek commissioner Garibaldi Thohir will become President Commissioner to lead the company’s non-executive board.

We are very proud and honored that our founder will move on to create impact at a larger scale, benefiting the whole nation.</p><p>“Nadiem leaves after an amazing nine years spent building the company from just an idea, into a multi-billion dollar business that reduces friction in the lives of people throughout Southeast Asia, while providing a source of income for millions. His achievements have been a source of inspiration to everyone at Gojek and he leaves the business at a time when there’s never been more excitement about its future potential. We now have over two million driver partners across Southeast Asia and over 500,000 merchants, all of whom together process over two billion transactions annually.</p><p>“Both of us have been running the Gojek business alongside Nadiem for some time, so there will be no disruption to the day to day operations or the amazing growth we have enjoyed over the years. Andre will focus on corporate functions and management of capital allocation, international expansion as well as payments and financial services, while Kevin will focus on the product development elements of the Gojek business as well as marketing, organisational development and the transportation and food delivery businesses.</p><p>“We are well prepared for the future and this is due in large part to the many outstanding industry leaders that have joined us over the past few years, and the collective vision and execution of the entire Gojek team.</p><p>“We would like to conclude by thanking the government of Indonesia for recognising the significance our business has had on society. We will respect the process the Palace has set out by not going into too much detail before tomorrow’s inauguration. We would also like to wish Nadiem the very best of luck as he embarks on this very important mission.”</p><p>Since co-founding Gojek, Kevin has held significant leadership roles across product and functional teams within the organisation.

We couldn’t be more optimistic about the company’s future and its continued positive impact to Indonesia’s economy and society.

It can be interpreted in a number of ways: a map\npin, the bull’s eye, an aerial view of a motorcyclist, or a power button. This\nreflects Gojek’s Super App proposition, with its multitude of offerings, which\nrange from transport, payments and food to logistics, entertainment and\nlifestyle.\n\nIn Indonesia, Gojek has built three Super Apps: one each for consumers,\ndriver-partners, and merchant partners. Each app provides its respective users\nwith services and features designed to make life better and help them to excel.\nFor example, the app for driver-partners is equipped with several functions that\nsupport financial planning, while the merchant app includes features that help\nwith business expansion, including logistics and inventory management.\n\nKevin Aluwi, Co-founder of Gojek Group, says: “Today, we introduce a new brand\nthat represents the evolution of Gojek from a transport company in Jakarta to a\nleading tech company in Southeast Asia. We have been on an extraordinary journey\nover the past four years and the new brand is designed to embody everything that\nhas been achieved throughout that period.\n\n“We are humbled that driver-partners, merchants, consumers and our employees\nhave had such faith in our brand and our company as we’ve grown. They are the\nones who have built this business into what it is today. Gojek is now many\nthings to many people — and our new logo reflects that. Even so, we remain\ncommitted to our founding principle and ethos of improving people’s lives\nthrough the use of technology.”\n\nAndre Soelistyo, President of Gojek Group, adds: “With the rebrand, we look\nforward to the next chapter of our growth, not only in Indonesia — where we have\nthe highest number of monthly active users compared to other on-demand platforms\n— but across the other Southeast Asian markets that we have expanded to over the\npast year. In each of those markets, our entry has been warmly received, a\ntestament to our technology and in-depth local knowledge, and the benefits that\nwe have delivered to local users.\n\n“Our goal has always been to create a great offering in each of our markets that\nmakes life easier for consumers, while delivering a positive social impact\nthroughout Southeast Asia.”\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFor media queries, please write to apoorva.babu@go-jek.com.","html":"<p>By Apoorva Babu</p><p>Gojek, the Indonesia-headquartered technology company, unveiled a new brand, designed to reflect its position as the leading technology platform in Southeast Asia.</p><p>The rebrand — which begins rolling out today — marks Gojek’s evolution from a Jakarta-based ride-hailing service to Southeast Asia’s leading Super App. It follows after the company recorded 1,100% growth in transactions on its platform over the last three years, from June 2016 to June 2019, on increased demand for Gojek’s integrated services.</p><p>Gojek has also significantly expanded its regional ecosystem since its app launched in 2015, having partnered with over 2 million driver-partners, 400,000 merchant partners and 60,000 service providers across Southeast Asia to-date.</p><p>Over the past three years, Gojek users have given over US$20 million in tips to the platform’s driver-partners and service providers, a testament to their support for and satisfaction with the Gojek brand.</p><p>The rebrand sets the course for Gojek’s next phase of growth, which will include further innovation and the strengthening of its integrated ecosystem of over 20 on-demand services — the region’s largest array of such offerings on a single platform.</p><p>The new logo, a nearly-rounded ring encircling a dot, is designed to be easily recognisable and versatile.

This reflects Gojek’s Super App proposition, with its multitude of offerings, which range from transport, payments and food to logistics, entertainment and lifestyle.</p><p>In Indonesia, Gojek has built three Super Apps: one each for consumers, driver-partners, and merchant partners. Each app provides its respective users with services and features designed to make life better and help them to excel. For example, the app for driver-partners is equipped with several functions that support financial planning, while the merchant app includes features that help with business expansion, including logistics and inventory management.</p><p><strong><strong>Kevin Aluwi</strong></strong>,<strong><strong> Co-founder of Gojek Group</strong></strong>, says: “Today, we introduce a new brand that represents the evolution of Gojek from a transport company in Jakarta to a leading tech company in Southeast Asia. We have been on an extraordinary journey over the past four years and the new brand is designed to embody everything that has been achieved throughout that period.</p><p>“We are humbled that driver-partners, merchants, consumers and our employees have had such faith in our brand and our company as we’ve grown. They are the ones who have built this business into what it is today. Gojek is now many things to many people — and our new logo reflects that. Even so, we remain committed to our founding principle and ethos of improving people’s lives through the use of technology.”</p><p><strong><strong>Andre Soelistyo</strong></strong>,<strong><strong> President of Gojek Group</strong></strong>, adds: “With the rebrand, we look forward to the next chapter of our growth, not only in Indonesia — where we have the highest number of monthly active users compared to other on-demand platforms — but across the other Southeast Asian markets that we have expanded to over the past year. In each of those markets, our entry has been warmly received, a testament to our technology and in-depth local knowledge, and the benefits that we have delivered to local users.</p><p>“Our goal has always been to create a great offering in each of our markets that makes life easier for consumers, while delivering a positive social impact throughout Southeast Asia.”</p><hr><p><strong><strong>For media queries, please write to apoorva.babu@go-jek.com.</strong></strong></p>","url":"https://gojek-ghost.zysk.in/gojek-southeast-asias-leading-super-app-launches-rebrand/","canonical_url":null,"uuid":"43430854-707e-4778-94ba-33e58e29445d","page":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_styles":null,"comment_id":"5ec2ab9b7aa22c4066f83a75","reading_time":2}},{"node":{"id":"Ghost__Post__5ec2aba47aa22c4066f83a79","title":"Gojek acquires AirCTO, expands operations in India","slug":"gojek-acquires-aircto-expands-operations-in-india","featured":false,"feature_image":"https://gojek-ghost.zysk.in/content/images/2020/05/1_pv9f5vZHkiQGWL-ymwtzgA.jpeg","excerpt":"The AirCTO team will aid GOJEK’s hiring efforts.
