Nadiem, Andre and Kevin have been\nrunning the business together for a number of years, which will ensure that this\nleadership transition will run smoothly.\n\nNadiem’s news was communicated in an email to all Gojek staff that was sent\ntoday. In the email, he looked back on how the company has grown over the past\nnine years and also set out his hopes for the future of the business:\n\n“We started this company with nothing, other than a deep desire to change things\nfor the better. We saw that the streets of Jakarta were a mess and that there\nwas an informal community of ojek drivers who could easily act as a huge part of\nthe solution to that mess, if only they were organised and working efficiently.\n\n“With just that initial desire to improve life for everyone, as well as a large\namount of support from countless friends, partners and stakeholders, we’ve\ncreated Gojek. An iconic company that flies the flag for the future of Indonesia\nand Southeast Asia.\n\n“I will leave Gojek in the capable hands of Andre Soelistyo and Kevin Aluwi as\nco-CEOs, both of whom have played central roles in moving the company along its\npath from that office in South Jakarta onto the global stage.\n\n“We got very lucky as we progressed along that path, but I believe that luck in\nbusiness only really becomes a valuable commodity if you have the brilliant\nminds needed to take advantage of it. Kevin and Andre have mentored me to be the\nleader I am today. They are quite simply Gojek’s best. They have been running\nthis company for a number of years and I have complete faith not just in their\ntechnical skills and ability to execute flawlessly, but also in their integrity\nand their desire to do the right thing every step of the way.\n\n“High emotions are involved in running a company like Gojek but Andre and Kevin\nare always the steady voices of reason, approaching problems with intelligence\nand compassion. I couldn’t ask for better successors as the Gojek movement\nbegins its next stage of growth.”\n\nA joint statement released by Andre and Kevin said: “When a friend and mentor\nleaves a business you have built together, there is always going to be some\nsadness, but we are both determined that Gojek will go from strength to\nstrength. We will continue to implement our vision as we focus on what the Gojek\nof the next ten years is going to be like.\n\n“This company has changed the lives of so many people in Indonesia and around\nthe region, and our key priority is to ensure that we can continue to act as a\npositive force in society for the foreseeable future.”\n\nUnder Andre and Kevin’s management, Gojek has grown exponentially, to process\nover two billion transactions a year. The company’s fundraising efforts have\nattracted some of the world’s most exciting companies including Google, Tencent,\nMitsubishi, Visa, AIA and Astra, with Series F set to raise well over US$2bn.\nThe company has also launched operations in Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam,\nwhile the Gojek app has become the most-used on-demand application in Indonesia,\nwhere its food and payments businesses have overtaken transport to become the\nlargest businesses within the group.\n\nWith the new structure, Andre will focus on corporate functions and management\nof capital allocation, international expansion as well as the payments and\nfinancial services businesses, while Kevin will focus on the product development\nelements of the Gojek business as well as marketing, organisational development\nand the transportation and food delivery businesses.\n\nSince co-founding Gojek, Kevin has held significant leadership roles across\nproduct and functional teams within the organisation. He has used his background\nin Business Intelligence to pioneer the use of data for decision-making across\nthe Gojek business. He has also assembled deep technology expertise across the\ndata, engineering and product teams, with a focus on enhancing the platform’s\noverall user experience. Prior to his role at Gojek, Kevin spent time at Zalora\nIndonesia, Merah Putih Incubator and Salem Partners.\n\nSimilarly, Andre has played a pivotal role in laying a solid foundation for\nGojek’s rapid growth. He has overseen over US$4bn of fundraising, which\nattracted key investors such as Google, Tencent, Astra, KKR and Warburg Pincus.\nHe has also laid the foundation for the company’s business strategy for long\nterm sustainability.

Our\nstakeholder support is key to Gojek’s success in evolving into an integrated\necosystem with three Super Apps that move people, things, and money.”\n\nThe prominent global list highlights how GoPay, Gojek’s digital payments\nplatform, has helped drive Indonesia’s digital economy by expanding financial\naccess for millions in Indonesia, where 64% of the population is ‘unbanked’.\n\nNadiem added, “At Gojek, it’s always about tackling challenges and enabling a\nbetter life for everyone in our ecosystem. From enabling cashless transactions\nfor consumers to ease of payments and business growth for merchants, GoPay has\nproven that #ThereIsAlwaysAWay to change the world for the better.”\n\nGoPay CEO Aldi Haryopratomo also expressed his gratitude for the trust placed in\nGoPay, “We have always focused on the grassroots. Since 2016, GoPay has quickly\ntransformed from a simple way for users to pay for Gojek services to driver\npartners now being able to use our platform to access mortgages, loans for\neducation, health insurance, and even save for Umrah. Today, GoPay is the\nlargest consumer digital payments platform in Indonesia and more than 90% of our\nGoPay merchants are micro, small, and medium enterprises. However, we do not\njust measure success in terms of current transaction volumes, but rather by how\nwe can create grassroots impact at a global scale.”\n\nNote: A merchant who uses GoPay to develop her business. As the biggest digital\npayments platform in Indonesia, GoPay not only eases payment transactions, but\nalso bridges driver partners and merchants to access various financial services\nsuch as KPR subsidies, education savings, health insurance, and Umrah savings.In\nits fifth year running, Fortune’s “Change the World” list is intended to\nshowcase the synergy between business strategy and the creation of positive\nsocial impact.\n\nThe assessment of nominees is conducted in partnership with the Shared Value\nInitiative, a global platform for organizations seeking business solutions to\nsocial challenges, and FSG, a non-profit social-impact consulting firm.\nFortune’s decision making on this award is based on four criteria: Measurable\nsocial impact, Business results, Degree of innovation, and Corporate\nIntegration.\n\n“GoPay’s strategy is to build an ecosystem with our partners. We believe that by\nincluding more people in the formal financial system, we can grow together with\nour partners which include banks, restaurants, retailers, and many more.\n\nMuch like a coral reef where the more coral and fish enhance the vibrancy of the\necosystem, we believe that the more partners we have, the more families we can\nhelp,” Aldi concluded.\n\nAbout Gojek Group\n\nGojek is a Super App. It’s one app for ordering food, commuting, digital\npayments, shopping, hyper-local delivery, getting a massage and two dozen\nservices. It is Indonesia’s first and fastest growing unicorn building an\non-demand empire across Southeast Asia.\n\nAs of 2018, Gojek processed more than $9 billion annualized gross transaction\nvalue (GTV) across all markets where it operates — in Singapore, Thailand and\nVietnam. The Gojek app was launched in 2015, and is now the largest consumer\ntransactional technology group on a GTV-basis in Southeast Asia.\n\nThe Gojek app is available for iOS and Android.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFor media queries, contact apoorva.babu@go-jek.com.","html":"<p>By Apoorva Babu</p><p>Gojek, Southeast Asia’s leading on-demand technology platform, once again made it to the annual Fortune <a href=\"https://fortune.com/change-the-world/2019\" rel=\"noopener\">‘Change the World’ list</a>.

It can be interpreted in a number of ways: a map\npin, the bull’s eye, an aerial view of a motorcyclist, or a power button. This\nreflects Gojek’s Super App proposition, with its multitude of offerings, which\nrange from transport, payments and food to logistics, entertainment and\nlifestyle.\n\nIn Indonesia, Gojek has built three Super Apps: one each for consumers,\ndriver-partners, and merchant partners. Each app provides its respective users\nwith services and features designed to make life better and help them to excel.\nFor example, the app for driver-partners is equipped with several functions that\nsupport financial planning, while the merchant app includes features that help\nwith business expansion, including logistics and inventory management.\n\nKevin Aluwi, Co-founder of Gojek Group, says: “Today, we introduce a new brand\nthat represents the evolution of Gojek from a transport company in Jakarta to a\nleading tech company in Southeast Asia. We have been on an extraordinary journey\nover the past four years and the new brand is designed to embody everything that\nhas been achieved throughout that period.\n\n“We are humbled that driver-partners, merchants, consumers and our employees\nhave had such faith in our brand and our company as we’ve grown. They are the\nones who have built this business into what it is today. Gojek is now many\nthings to many people — and our new logo reflects that. Even so, we remain\ncommitted to our founding principle and ethos of improving people’s lives\nthrough the use of technology.”\n\nAndre Soelistyo, President of Gojek Group, adds: “With the rebrand, we look\nforward to the next chapter of our growth, not only in Indonesia — where we have\nthe highest number of monthly active users compared to other on-demand platforms\n— but across the other Southeast Asian markets that we have expanded to over the\npast year.
