GoFood — Gojek’s food\ndelivery product — lists 400,000+ merchants. You search for the outlet you want\nto order from, select the item and quantity, check out, and pay either via cash\nor Gojek’s digital wallet GoPay. Then, you sit back and watch the little Gojek\ndriver partner on the screen zoom their way to the restaurant, and bring you\nsome fried banana goodness. 😍\n\nSimple. Fast. Reliable.\n\n> Rewind a few years, and things didn’t look so good.\nFirst, some context\nWhen GoFood launched in 2015, expansion and adoption happened rapidly. The\norders started piling in, and we were struggling to keep up with demand.\nInitially, we’d simply list food merchants on our marketplace, send demand their\nway, and fulfil it through our fleet of driver partners.\n\nWe were building for our consumers and driver partners, but merchants were\nalways a key component of our ecosystem. If Gojek is an iceberg, the\nconsumer-facing Super App is the part above water. In this story, we’ll dive\nbeneath the surface to explore another key component — GoBiz, our merchant\nSuperApp.\n\n> But before GoBiz, there was GoResto.\nThe Merchant Problem\nIf we had ordered ourselves that pisang goreng in the early days of GoFood,\nthings would have worked very differently.\n\nYou see, merchants were onboarded by the GoFood team by uploading their menus to\nour systems. We’d look through these menus to find our fried banana of choice,\nand make an order, which would be relayed directly to a driver partner. This\npartner would then go to the restaurant and place the order (which is when the\nmerchant partner gets involved in the process).\n\nSo, while our bananas are fried, the driver partner would wait around, and when\nthe order is ready, pay in cash. The problem with this approach was that there\nwas no record of the transaction besides a booking on GoFood and a receipt\nhanded to the driver partner.\n\nThis was an inefficient system, for driver partners, and our customers.\n\n> Oh, and those merchants? Things weren’t rosy for them either.\nLet’s assume our pisang goreng place is a GoFood partner (meaning Gojek collects\ncommissions for the increased demand we send their way), and also part of a\nlarger chain. When we place the order, GoFood will assign it to one outlet of\nthe chain. However, our driver partner may decide to visit another outlet and\npick up the order from there.\n\nAt the end of the month, our restaurant partners would be invoiced for\ncommission that was due to us, based on sales as reported by the GoFood app.\nThis meant we were charging some merchants commission for sales their outlet may\nhave never made.\n\nWe spent a lot of time and resources addressing merchant complaints. 🤦‍♂️\n\n> Then there was the matter of control.\nIf a merchant partner was not open for business on a particular day, wanted to\nupdate their menu, or indicate items as out of stock, they had to call Gojek\nCustomer Care. During this time, orders might still be coming in.\n\nLet’s just say we weren’t doing ourselves any favours. 🤷🏻‍♂️\n\nThere was a lot that needed fixing here, and it could only be done by\nintegrating merchants more deeply into our ecosystem. So that’s what we did.\n\nThe birth of GoResto\nTowards the end of 2016, a concept was developed for an app that would cater to\nGoFood merchant partners, and by early 2017 GoResto — which is what we called it\nat the time — was ready. You can read more about the product research process\nthat went into making GoResto here\n[https://blog.gojekengineering.com/whats-cooking-diving-into-kitchens-for-go-biz-e01051bfdc98]\n).\n\nWith GoResto, we addressed some of the problems outlined earlier.\n\n1. Electronic payments\nAll of Gojek’s driver partners had GoPay e-wallets associated with their\naccounts. With GoResto, we did the same for GoFood merchants. Transactions\nbetween driver and merchant partners would now be wallet-to-wallet, not cash.\nGojek would deduct any applicable commission immediately from the merchant\nwallet. This made the reconciliation process with merchants simpler.\n\n2. PIN exchange for restaurant verification\nTo eliminate fraud, driver partners would also need to share a PIN with the\nmerchant while picking up the order. This electronic handshake helped us verify\nthey were indeed picking up the right order from the right outlet.\n\nIt was a decent solution. If all went according to plan, we could breathe easy.\n\n> As you might have guessed, all did not go according to plan. 🙇‍♂️\nIn the first iteration, the wallet creation process required collaboration with\nthe GoPay team, which was itself facing bandwidth constraints due to rapid\ngrowth (which we’ll talk about a little later).\n\nAlso, the merchant onboarding to GoResto at this point was still a manual\nprocess. In our first month, we onboarded only 26 merchants. 😣\n\nWe needed a more scalable solution.\n\nHere’s a quick note on Gojek company culture. When the chips are down, it’s\nimportant for organisations to have core values to guide decision-making. One of\nour values happens to be:\n\nThis line is an affirmation to all stakeholders to take the best decision for a\nparticular situation based on available information. Such decisions are then\nrespected by everyone else.\n\nWe made two drastic decisions:\n\n 1. Merchant onboarding was completely frozen until we could build a platform to\n    automate the process.\n 2. Engineers from the Merchants team were embedded within GoPay, building\n    required capacities on GoPay systems while core GoPay engineers continued\n    work on scaling the platform.\n\n> In three months, as summer rolled around, GoResto was back.\nWe weren’t out of the woods yet though. All this was happening before Gojek had\ndeprecated its legacy codebase, Stan Marsh\n[https://blog.gojekengineering.com/thank-you-stan-marsh-29db553544bf], in favour\nof microservices, so system stability was not exactly excellent. As a result, we\nstill faced sync issues between GoFood and GoResto order management systems.\nThis, in turn, began to reflect on us publicly.\n\nOur app store rating at this point slid down to 3.2.\n\nMake It Work, Then Make It Better\nWe clearly had a long way to go to make GoResto the app our merchants deserved.\nThings were bad, but as they say — sometimes the only way out is through.\n\nChallenge accepted. 💪\n\nFirst things first, we went about fixing the sync issues by building a second\nsystem to replace our unreliable version. Not only was this accomplished, but\nall onboarded merchants were migrated to the new system, with zero downtime. \nRead more about how this was done in this post\n[https://blog.gojekengineering.com/zero-downtime-traffic-migration-at-go-food-17ba413eb8c2]\n.\n\n> One small win.\nNow for the real problems, giving merchants the control they needed over how\nthey were represented on GoFood. The first self-serve feature we introduced to\nGoResto was allowing merchants to update their restaurant status in real time.\n\n> Another small win.\nWe had unlocked a critical component in product design — empathy for the people\nyou’re building for. The question now was — what can we do that will make life\neasier for our merchants?\n\nItem availability? Understood.\nMenu updation? Got it.\nPricing adjustments? Why not.\nAdd categories? Move items between categories? Update images?\n\n> Done, done… and done. ✅\nOur systems were stable, early teething troubles were addressed, we were finally\nsolving the problems that needed solving.\n\nBuild It Right, And They Will Come\nAs GoResto grew in functionality, we began\n\n slowly earning back the goodwill of our merchant community. Soon, our app store\nrating began to reflect that.\n\nApp store ratings reflecting how customer goodwill can be earned back ✌️We\ndidn’t need to push GoResto to merchants anymore, it was adopted due to the ease\nof doing business it offered.\n\n> It was long overdue, but we had accomplished what we had set out to do. There\nwas finally a moment to sit back and enjoy the sunrise.\nOr so we thought.\n\nThe rest was short-lived. Southeast Asia was abuzz with activity.

Sign up for our newsletter!\n[https://mailchi.mp/go-jek/gojek-tech-newsletter]","html":"<p>By Sooraj Rajmohan</p><p>Earlier this year, during a visit to Gojek’s HQ in Jakarta, a few of us from the Gojek Marketing team had a craving to try Indonesia’s famed fried delicacy — <em><em>pisang goreng.</em></em></p><p>Today, fulfilling such food cravings is a simple process. GoFood — Gojek’s food delivery product — lists 400,000+ merchants. You search for the outlet you want to order from, select the item and quantity, check out, and pay either via cash or Gojek’s digital wallet GoPay. Then, you sit back and watch the little Gojek driver partner on the screen zoom their way to the restaurant, and bring you some fried banana goodness. 😍</p><p><strong><strong>Simple. Fast. Reliable.</strong></strong></p><blockquote>Rewind a few years, and things didn’t look so good.</blockquote><h1 id=\"first-some-context\">First, some context</h1><p>When GoFood launched in 2015, expansion and adoption happened rapidly. The orders started piling in, and we were struggling to keep up with demand. Initially, we’d simply list food merchants on our marketplace, send demand their way, and fulfil it through our fleet of driver partners.</p><p>We were building for our consumers and driver partners, but merchants were always a key component of our ecosystem. If Gojek is an iceberg, the consumer-facing Super App is the part above water. In this story, we’ll dive beneath the surface to explore another key component — GoBiz, our merchant SuperApp.</p><blockquote>But before GoBiz, there was GoResto.</blockquote><h1 id=\"the-merchant-problem\">The Merchant Problem</h1><p>If we had ordered ourselves that <em><em>pisang goreng</em></em> in the early days of GoFood, things would have worked very differently.</p><p>You see, merchants were onboarded by the GoFood team by uploading their menus to our systems. We’d look through these menus to find our fried banana of choice, and make an order, which would be relayed directly to a driver partner. This partner would then go to the restaurant and place the order (which is when the merchant partner gets involved in the process).</p><p>So, while our bananas are fried, the driver partner would wait around, and when the order is ready, pay in cash. The problem with this approach was that there was no record of the transaction besides a booking on GoFood and a receipt handed to the driver partner.</p><p>This was an inefficient system, for driver partners, and our customers.</p><blockquote><em><em>Oh, and those merchants? Things weren’t rosy for them either.</em></em></blockquote><p>Let’s assume our <em><em>pisang goreng</em></em> place is a GoFood partner (meaning Gojek collects commissions for the increased demand we send their way), and also part of a larger chain. When we place the order, GoFood will assign it to one outlet of the chain. However, our driver partner may decide to visit another outlet and pick up the order from there.</p><p>At the end of the month, our restaurant partners would be invoiced for commission that was due to us, based on sales as reported by the GoFood app. This meant we were charging some merchants commission for sales their outlet may have never made.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/428/1*-ZP7pyLDGJo31gjM1kbr2Q.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p><strong><strong>We spent a lot of time and resources addressing merchant complaints. </strong></strong>🤦‍♂️</p><blockquote>Then there was the matter of control.</blockquote><p>If a merchant partner was not open for business on a particular day, wanted to update their menu, or indicate items as out of stock, they had to call Gojek Customer Care. During this time, orders might still be coming in.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/723/1*7mru-w9gwgvBTO-wReUymw.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p><strong><strong>Let’s just say we weren’t doing ourselves any favours. 🤷🏻‍♂️</strong></strong></p><p>There was a lot that needed fixing here, and it could only be done by integrating merchants more deeply into our ecosystem. So that’s what we did.</p><h1 id=\"the-birth-of-goresto\">The birth of GoResto</h1><p>Towards the end of 2016, a concept was developed for an app that would cater to GoFood merchant partners, and by early 2017 GoResto — which is what we called it at the time — was ready. You can read more about the product research process that went into making GoResto <a href=\"https://blog.gojekengineering.com/whats-cooking-diving-into-kitchens-for-go-biz-e01051bfdc98\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>).</p><p><strong><strong><em><em>With GoResto, we addressed some of the problems outlined earlier.</em></em></strong></strong></p><h2 id=\"1-electronic-payments\">1. Electronic payments</h2><p>All of Gojek’s driver partners had GoPay e-wallets associated with their accounts. With GoResto, we did the same for GoFood merchants. Transactions between driver and merchant partners would now be wallet-to-wallet, not cash. Gojek would deduct any applicable commission immediately from the merchant wallet. This made the reconciliation process with merchants simpler.</p><h2 id=\"2-pin-exchange-for-restaurant-verification\">2. PIN exchange for restaurant verification</h2><p>To eliminate fraud, driver partners would also need to share a PIN with the merchant while picking up the order. This electronic handshake helped us verify they were indeed picking up the right order from the right outlet.</p><p>It was a decent solution. If all went according to plan, we could breathe easy.</p><blockquote>As you might have guessed, all did not go according to plan. 🙇‍♂️</blockquote><p>In the first iteration, the wallet creation process required collaboration with the GoPay team, which was itself facing bandwidth constraints due to rapid growth (which we’ll talk about a little later).</p><p>Also, the merchant onboarding to GoResto at this point was still a manual process. In our first month, we onboarded only 26 merchants. 😣</p><p>We needed a more scalable solution.</p><p>Here’s a quick note on Gojek company culture. When the chips are down, it’s important for organisations to have core values to guide decision-making. One of our values happens to be:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1326/1*AcfpMzeJqM2bj5x8TedY7A.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>This line is an affirmation to all stakeholders to take the best decision for a particular situation based on available information. Such decisions are then respected by everyone else.</p><p>We made two drastic decisions:</p><ol><li>Merchant onboarding was completely frozen until we could build a platform to automate the process.</li><li>Engineers from the Merchants team were embedded within GoPay, building required capacities on GoPay systems while core GoPay engineers continued work on scaling the platform.</li></ol><blockquote>In three months, as summer rolled around, GoResto was back.</blockquote><p>We weren’t out of the woods yet though. All this was happening before Gojek had deprecated its legacy codebase, <a href=\"https://blog.gojekengineering.com/thank-you-stan-marsh-29db553544bf\" rel=\"noopener\">Stan Marsh</a>, in favour of microservices, so system stability was not exactly excellent. As a result, we still faced sync issues between GoFood and GoResto order management systems. This, in turn, began to reflect on us publicly.</p><p><strong><strong>Our app store rating at this point slid down to 3.2.</strong></strong></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/794/1*tK41Ht4hzRXSuKNR5w2qxA.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><h1 id=\"make-it-work-then-make-it-better\">Make It Work, Then Make It Better</h1><p>We clearly had a long way to go to make GoResto the app our merchants deserved. Things were bad, but as they say — sometimes the only way out is through.</p><p><strong><strong>Challenge accepted. 💪</strong></strong></p><p>First things first, we went about fixing the sync issues by building a second system to replace our unreliable version. Not only was this accomplished, but all onboarded merchants were migrated to the new system, with <em><em>zero downtime. </em></em>Read more about how this was done <a href=\"https://blog.gojekengineering.com/zero-downtime-traffic-migration-at-go-food-17ba413eb8c2\" rel=\"noopener\">in this post</a>.</p><blockquote><em><em>One small win.</em></em></blockquote><p>Now for the real problems, giving merchants the control they needed over how they were represented on GoFood. The first self-serve feature we introduced to GoResto was allowing merchants to update their restaurant status in real time.</p><blockquote><em><em>Another small win.</em></em></blockquote><p>We had unlocked a critical component in product design — empathy for the people you’re building for. The question now was — what can we do that will make life easier for our merchants?</p><p><em><em>Item availability?</em></em> Understood.<br><em><em>Menu updation?</em></em> Got it.<br><em><em>Pricing adjustments?</em></em> Why not.<br><em><em>Add categories? Move items between categories? Update images?</em></em></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/522/1*bRzkmDwhHIrGOEJDz45a1A.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><blockquote>Done, done… and done. ✅</blockquote><p>Our systems were stable, early teething troubles were addressed, we were finally solving the problems that needed solving.</p><h1 id=\"build-it-right-and-they-will-come\">Build It Right, And They Will Come</h1><p>As GoResto grew in functionality, we began</p><p> slowly earning back the goodwill of our merchant community. Soon, our app store rating began to reflect that.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1864/1*j3tGYn7EvCzlh46jk5cyPw.png\" class=\"kg-image\"><figcaption>App store ratings reflecting how customer goodwill can be earned back ✌️</figcaption></figure><p>We didn’t need to push GoResto to merchants anymore, it was adopted due to the ease of doing business it offered.</p><blockquote><em><em>It was long overdue, but we had accomplished what we had set out to do. There was finally a moment to sit back and enjoy the sunrise.</em></em></blockquote><p>Or so we thought.</p><p>The rest was short-lived. Southeast Asia was abuzz with activity. <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/documents/47/SEA_Internet_Economy_Report_2019.pdf\" rel=\"noopener\">According to this report</a>, the value of the Internet economy in the region tripled in the years since 2015.

Part\ntwo, which chronicles the journey of GOJEK’s Vietnam launch under the GO-VIET\nbrand, is here [http://bit.ly/2Rm2cSC].\n\nOn to part three then:\n\nPart 3/3 | Accomplishment\nThe atmosphere in Vietnam was celebratory. The GO-VIET launch had gone better\nthan anticipated, and our attempt to build robust, scalable systems looked to\nhave paid off. Ride and Send services were live in Vietnam, and engineers from\nGO-FOOD had already started working with Trifecta — the team spearheading\nGOJEK’s international moves — to launch our food product in Vietnam (FYI, it’s\nlive now).\n\nIn the months following Vietnam launch, Trifecta focused on setting up cadences\nwith different GOJEK product teams to streamline development and release cycles\nfor GO-VIET. Everything was up and running.\n\nNow, for the next stage — Thailand.\n\nThe launch plan for Thailand was similar to what had been executed in Vietnam,\nincluding the products made available at launch (Ride and Send). In Thailand,\nthe brand would launch under the name GET.\n\n> We had proven it could be done. Now it was time to do it again. Easy, right?\nAs would soon become apparent, not really. This ride had a few last twists left.\n\nA Different Method\nWhile our Thailand operation would be similar to Vietnam on the infrastructure\nfront, to say we could just replicate the model as is would be an\noversimplification. For starters, Thailand’s currency, the Thai Baht, was not a\ndepreciated currency like Indonesian Rupiah or Vietnamese Dong.\n\n> Here’s some context:\n> 1 Indonesian Rupiah (IDR) = 0.0049 INR\n1 Vietnamese Dong (VND) = 0.0030 INR\n1 Thai Baht (THB) = 2.2 INR\nIncorporating this change would require some additional work from the team. On\ntop of this, the ride sharing market in Thailand is regulated by the Thai\ngovernment. Existing bike taxis (locally called WIN taxis) are licensed by the\ngovernment to serve as an effective mode of transportation. GOJEK’s entry into\nthe market provided an opportunity for WIN drivers to leverage the online\nplatform, while giving customers easy access to transportation\n\nThis arrangement required some work as well, as existing WIN drivers onboarded\nto GET would need to be prioritised initially while our own onboarding and\ntraining happened in parallel. All this meant that the launch model needed some\ntweaking, but nothing the team would need to sweat over too much.\n\nTalks were completed, local business teams were built, and a deadline was agreed\nupon with the Thai government to launch GET.\n\n> We should have known; rarely do companies building, scaling, and expanding at\nGOJEK’s pace experience such smooth sailing.\nThe Singapore Swing\nWorks, meet spanner.\n\nDue to the seismic shift in the ride-sharing business landscape of Southeast\nAsia in early 2018, GOJEK was also prepping for launch in Singapore on an\naccelerated timeline. Now was a good time to enter the lucrative market — the\nmost developed in the region. GOJEK already enjoyed brand recognition thanks to\nthe amount of business travel between Jakarta and Singapore. By May 2018, a few\nmonths before GO-VIET went live, the launch teams for Singapore had already been\nformed.\n\n> Keeping with Singapore’s iconic lion motif, we named these teams Simba and\nMufasa. Stay tuned to this blog for their story, coming soon. 🦁\nAs 2018 drew on and all teams worked to hit their deadlines, the situation felt\na lot like the storms GOJEK weathered in its infancy. Multiple teams were\ndependent on the same resources as we lined up back-to-back country launches. To\ntop it all, holiday season — one of the busiest times of the year — was also\nkicking off.\n\nvia GIPHY [https://giphy.com/gifs/2oj7STwCx7wAM]\n\nWhile Trifecta had built much of the infrastructure framework required for\nlaunch, there were still dependencies on key GOJEK teams that were currently\nbuilding for Singapore. This threatened to slow down what was an otherwise\nstraightforward development timeline.\n\nThere was also that commitment of a launch date to the Thai Government to think\nabout. The stakes were not trivial.\n\n> The team could not afford to lose more time. Time for desperate measures.\nWith just about a month left for launch, the team members — distributed across\nmultiple locations — convened at the GOJEK Bangalore office. All the\ndocumentation done during the pre-Vietnam launch phase meant that everyone had a\nfair idea of what needed to be done. Launching Singapore and Thailand without\ndelay was critical to business, and we could not afford delays.\n\nWith this in mind, tough decisions were made. The Trifecta team decided to roll\nup their sleeves and take full ownership of Thailand, freeing up the GOJEK\nTransport team to dedicate more resources to Singapore. Trifecta team members\nflew in to Thailand to coordinate the work there, and the project slowly picked\nup steam once again. All the legwork done at the beginning of this exercise had\ncome to fruition.\n\nThe team now had enough context about GOJEK services, and as the days to launch\nticked away, so did the items on the pre-launch checklist.\n\nIt took some doing, with the environment and frameworks built and stabilised\nwhile activities like driver onboarding and early alpha testing happened in\nparallel.\n\n> The going was not easy, but this wasn’t our first rodeo.\nTrifecta Tech Lead Sumit Gupta, who was around in early 2016 during GOJEK’s\nfrantic growth as well, mentions how everyone was more confident this time\naround. Thanks to to the team deciding to build a fast and scalable\ncontainer-based architecture for Vietnam and Thailand, they were sure the system\nwould function reliably. 💪\n\nThe home stretch\nDespite the apprehensions, Trifecta managed to pull through. What had been a\nsystem unfit for launch just a few weeks before the stipulated date, was up and\nrunning with a couple of days to go. The team’s faith was well-rewarded. As\nlaunch day came around, nothing broke.\n\nBagus Santoso and Ardi Priono, QAs on the Trifecta team, recall how everyone\npresent gathered outside the GET office on the day of the soft launch, and\nprayed.\n\n> People of different nationalities, faiths, and professional backgrounds, united\nin a moment of reflection and hope for something they had built together.\nThe day of the soft launch.On November 29, 2018, the GOJEK app successfully went\nlive in Singapore. The next month, December 18 to be precise, GET’s fluorescent\ncolours lit up Bangkok. We were officially live in Thailand. \n\nRiding off to new horizons.> Our SuperApp had ventured beyond home. Team Trifecta\nhad accomplished the task it had been set.\n> Looking back, this had been an ambitious endeavour. Setting up new environments,\nusing the learnings from scaling GOJEK to build improved infrastructure, and\nlaunching two new brands.\nIf there was one thing this exercise taught us, it was to reduce dependencies.\nToday, each GOJEK team is responsible for maintaining their product features and\nservices wherever they may be deployed.\n\nIn service of this decision, Trifecta started the exercise of imparting all the\nknowledge, tools, and documentation gathered over the year to the relevant teams\nwithin GOJEK. Hands-on sessions and workshops were held, and learnings\ntransferred. The goal now was to provide each team the tools and autonomy\nrequired to not face such roadblocks again.\n\n> Once this process was complete, their task done, the fellowship that steered\nGOJEK to foreign lands was disbanded.\nArmed with new experience, the GOJEK engineers left Trifecta and joined other\nproduct teams. As for that specialist team that was brought in at the beginning\nof this story, the valuable experience they brought to the table would always be\nuseful to a company that is taking on challenging projects. They moved to\nGOJEK’s newly-formed Kernel team, to help take on one of our biggest challenges\nyet.\n\nBut that is a story for another day.\n\nThis series was a snapshot of how we do things at GOJEK. Even as you read this,\nthere are many more such stories developing. Keep watching this space!\n\nOr better yet, join us [http://bit.ly/2Lubjke] and become a part of the story.\nThere’s plenty to do and much to learn.\n\nThanks for reading! 🙌\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWant more where that came from?

If you haven’t\nread part one, get up to speed here.\n\nPart 2/3 | Initiation\nWhen we left Trifecta — the team responsible for charting GOJEK’s international\nexpansion — in the last part of this series, the team was working on setting up\na new environment for launch in Vietnam. But now, there were new problems to\ntackle.\n\nProblem #1: Configuration drift\n\nUntil this point, GOJEK had always operated within Indonesia, but Trifecta was\nnow in unmapped territory, building a completely new environment for GOJEK’s\nservices in Vietnam. The services now needed to be configured separately across\ngeographies, and there was no central location to manage these configurations\neffectively. This meant there was a chance of configuration inconsistencies\ncreeping in over time (hence the term ‘drift’).\n\nProblem #2: Deployment drift\n\nEven if the team hacked a solution for the first problem, deploying the code\nwould pose another one. It was imperative that the same version of code run on\nall the environments (the existing one in Indonesia, the one being built for\nVietnam, and any future ones). Failing this, supporting services across\ncountries would be a nightmare.\n\n> That wasn’t the kind of risk a startup that expounds lean engineering could\nafford to take.\nProblem #3: A logging and monitoring solution for the Kubernetes cluster.\n\nAs this was the first time containers were being used by GOJEK, a new logging\nsolution would be required for future debugging needs.\n\nMuch time had been lost already, it was time to bring in the big guns.\n\nEven as the team dodged obstacles and took detours, making the best use of\navailable resources, Project Managers Sourabh Gupta and Sanchit Juneja had been\ncommunicating with other teams for backup. They had found some ad-hoc support,\nbut to see this journey through would need more seasoned soldiers.\n\nFinally, this effort came to fruition.\n\nTrifecta V2.0\nAfter some negotiation, the team got the go-ahead for Sumit Gupta, another GOJEK\nveteran, to make the transition from GOJEK’s Atlas team to join Trifecta full\ntime. Sumit had led GOJEK’s scaling efforts back in 2015, when the company was\nin constant firefighting mode, and knew a thing or two about dealing with the\nkind of situation the team was in. He would now assume the role of Trifecta’s\nTech Lead.\n\nWith a renewed sense of purpose, the team looked back at the roadmap and\nreassessed priorities. This would be a challenging project. Daunting, yes.\nInsurmountable? Not quite.\n\n> If you’ve read GOJEK’s essential reading list\n[https://blog.gojekengineering.com/the-go-jek-reading-list-1088712ccc14], you\nmay have noticed that The Mythical Man Month is one of the books we swear by,\nand one of its core tenets is: “Adding more people to a late software project\nmakes it later.”\n> We added four more engineers to the team.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDimensions and distant visions\nGOJEK did not have previously devised solutions for the drifts it was dealing\nwith. It needed new ones.\n\nTackling configuration drift.\n\nIt would now be Trifecta’s job to create a location within which services for\ndifferent environments could be configured and accessed.\n\nThe solution was a service that used a new API to update configurations across\ngeographies. These were then migrated to a configuration store.\n\nThis store was named Yggdrasil, the mythical Norse tree that connects the nine\nrealms. Even in the frenzied sprint to accomplish a daunting task, we could\nnever resist the temptation of poetic nomenclature. 😅\n\n> Yggdrasil changed how configs were stored and managed in GOJEK.\nTackling deployment drift\n\nCode.\n\nCode fuels GOJEK, and ensuring that updated code is running in sync is one of\nthe primary objectives of any team. Trifecta was no different — except for\nscale.\n\nThe team needed to figure out a way to ensure that the same version of code ran\nacross multiple, disconnected environments. It was time to forge a new\naccessory.\n\n> A Palantir — a seeing stone.\nWhen new versions of an application are released, there is a need to deploy the\nsame version on all countries for the given environment. Palantir would take\ncare of figuring out which countries the given deployment should go to.\n\nThe team also built a UI for Palantir, which gave a view of what version of a\nservice was deployed in which cluster and sent alerts when there was a drift.\n\nTackling the logging problem\n\nAs launch date drew closer, this particular problem required non-linear\nthinking. Trifecta implemented an out-of-the-box solution using Stackdriver to\nunblock themselves for the launch. This was not optimal, but it provided enough\nbreathing room to get through launch (post which specific tooling for logging on\ncontainers could be created).\n\nOnce again, the destination appeared near. With Yggdrasil keeping the services\nstable and Palantir keeping watch on code, GO-VIET was no longer a wistful\ndream, it was a visible apparition.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRun with Red\nIf you visit Indonesia, chances are you’ll see bright flecks of green amidst the\ntraffic.\n\n> Green jackets, green helmets, green… everywhere. Green is now part of GOJEK’s\nidentity in Indonesia, it is instant mental recall for the brand.\n> But this was not Indonesia.\n> GO-VIET, it was decided, would be born in red.\nA local leadership team was put together in order to assemble other teams\nrequired for launch. This team was also flown to Jakarta to understand GOJEK’s\nvalues and how it works. These would serve as the core values for GO-VIET as\nwell, with the leadership adapting things as required to suit Vietnam.\n\nMeanwhile, Trifecta was stabilising the launch environment, collaborating with\nthe newly-minted team in Vietnam, and working with multiple GOJEK teams.\n\nBy June of 2018, the backend was ready. A working driver and consumer app, as\nwell as on-boarding portals for driver partners had been set up, along with\ncrucial business-related teams like BI and Fraud. GO-VIET was taking shape right\nin front of its makers’ eyes.\n\n> Now for the testing:\nOver the next one month, the app, and by extension, the new environment and\nassorted services, were put through the wringer. First, employees mocking as\ndrivers tried it in a staging environment, then the actual on-boarded drivers\nwere given a shot, so the team could record their feedback.\n\nTesting then moved to the production environment. It was time for the real deal.\nThe dry runs began, and in the final phase of testing, early adopters were given\naccess to try out the alpha version of the app.\n\nFinally, it was done. The environment, the services, the app, the operations,\nthe tree, the stone… they had all survived.\n\n> GO-VIET was ready.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe final push\nJuly 31, 2018 — Vietnam Beckoned\n\nThe environment was ready, everything was up and running.

A\nmelting pot of ethnicities and cultures, home to the fourth largest population\nin the world, and ripe with business opportunity. This dazzling island nation is\nwhere GOJEK was born. Its chaotic streets were the playground where a scrappy\nyoung startup grew, and the love of its people saw GOJEK grow into a Super App.\n\n> For GOJEK, Indonesia is home. Comfortable. Familiar. Safe.\nThe story of a Super App, however, is about more than one country. It is about\ngrowing up, stepping out the door, and journeying into the unknown. This\nthree-part series details GOJEK’s journey beyond Indonesia’s borders, and the\nstory of the team that guided it through roads untraveled.\n\nThe mandate. The madness.\nIn late 2017, at a meeting of product leads at GOJEK’s Jakarta HQ, then COO\nRohan Monga confirmed the rumour that had been floating around hallways.\n\n> We were going abroad.\nOn paper, the idea was simple: GOJEK was targeting new markets in Southeast Asia\n— starting with Vietnam, Thailand and Philippines.\n\nThe reason for choosing these geographies went beyond the obvious (proximity).\nThese countries have similar dynamics to pre-GOJEK Indonesia. The population\nnumbers are in the same ballpark, broadband Internet penetration is high (and\ngrowing rapidly), the food delivery market is nascent, and there was no dominant\nplayer in the digital wallet space.\n\n> The conditions were ripe for disruption.\nThe plan was to launch swiftly and stealthily, and take competition by surprise.\nEach targeted geography even got its own codename. Vietnam was nicknamed Vogue,\nThailand dubbed Tatler, and Philippines — Fortune (notice a pattern? 😋)\n\nThis was only the beginning, however. The plan was more elaborate.\n\nIt was important to recreate this feeling of pride in the brand in the new\nmarkets as well. To achieve this, it was decided to launch the new offerings\nwith completely new branding — GO-VIET in Vietnam, and GET in Thailand.\nEverything about these new local brands was devised to emphasise the values of\nthat country.\n\nThe goal: to build a local champion — one that the people, as well as commercial\nand regulatory agencies — could get behind. The vision was solid. Everyone was\npumped.\n\nBut there was a problem:\n\n> Our existing tech stack was already buckling under the strain of ever-increasing\ndemand, and would not be able to handle new geographies.\nWe would need a different solution. GOJEK had crossed the borders of the\nfamiliar, into the unknown.\n\nOne of the options that made sense was to decouple from Indonesia and create new\nenvironments for the new countries. This way, the scaling issues affecting\nIndonesia would not affect the new geographies, and GOJEK developers also got\ngreater flexibility to customise and localise the app and products for the new\nmarkets.\n\nBut creating new environments/clusters (read mini-GOJEKs) came with its own set\nof complexities. This process also needed to be repeated in quick succession in\neach country.\n\nThe answer to this problem was using automation for cluster creation… but not on\nVM’s. To do something new, new technologies would have to be adopted. The path\nchosen was to use Kubernetes to automate cluster creation and service deployment\non containers.\n\nUnfortunately, no one at GOJEK had the insights or the bandwidth required to do\nthis at the time. We had the vision. We knew what needed to be done.\n\n> We needed the right people.\nEnter Team Trifecta\nIt all started with a Product Manager, who was tasked with putting together a\ngroup of people to accomplish the task ahead. About a week in, three QAs joined,\nfollowed in another week by an eight-member crack team who would develop the\ninitial Proof Of Concept (POC). The members of this team were cherry-picked from\nacross GOJEK product teams (with a fair bit of negotiation and bargaining\ninvolved 😅).\n\nIt would be this team’s duty to first run an efficient proof-of-concept (POC)\nfor the launch, and then develop frameworks, create playbooks, do product\ncustomisation and automate infrastructure creation and deployment. The idea was\nto create a scalable model and replicate it in any new country GOJEK wanted to\nlaunch in.\n\nInternational expansion was a big deal though, and an exciting challenge. As\nTrifecta’s work picked up steam, more people would put up their hands to work on\nthis exciting new project, over and above their existing responsibilities.\n\nWhile the core Trifecta team went about its business to create a POC, a\nspecialist four-person team was brought in. Their job was to work in parallel on\nour big play — automate cluster creation.\n\n> We had a fellowship. It was time for the journey.\nTrifecta’s first task was to figure out all the changes that had to be made to\nbuild a new app for each country. As soon as this project started, it became\napparent that a long uphill climb lay ahead.\n\nFor starters, the driver app was never built in a way to support any other\nlanguage besides Bahasa Indonesia. This had to be re-engineered so it could\nsupport localisation/i18n.\n\nAnd then there was Stan Marsh.\n\nStan Marsh [https://blog.gojekengineering.com/thank-you-stan-marsh-29db553544bf] \nis a legendary name in the GOJEK mythos. It refers to our late legacy codebase.\nStan Marsh was the beast of burden that carried GOJEK through the early years,\nand each new commit made to it was often a desperate attempt to douse a fire and\nkeep GOJEK up and running. Understandably, a lot of legacy services and Stan\nMarsh were not designed to support GOJEK’s journey into new geographies.\n\nTrifecta members found stumbling blocks everywhere — there was no provision for\nnew currencies and time zones, for example. The pack mule was struggling to keep\nup with the party.\n\nOne thing was obvious — GOJEK’s entire mobile codebase had to be re-architected\nto be able to efficiently build multiple apps and designs on top of it.\n\n> Automation on Kubernetes would have to wait.\n> We had a detour to take.\nDescending into the mines\nFirst things first — Trifecta needed an environment to play around in and do the\ntesting without affecting the BAU. The team dusted off an old User Acceptance\nTesting (UAT) environment, which was not in use at the time, and proceeded to do\nexperimentation and development within it. Slowly, the GOJEK app was dismantled\nand rebuilt into a new avatar that would service new markets.\n\nThis turned out to be a lot more complicated than it first sounded (which is a\ncommon plot point throughout this story, as you will see 😐). Major changes\nneeded to be made to the driver onboarding portal, for instance, and the team\nneeded to figure out ways to transfer money from the wallets of driver partners\ninto their bank accounts.\n\nGOJEK was always used to having multiple support teams, and well-established\nbank integrations to help with such matters. In this new territory, it all\nneeded to be figured out from scratch. Add to the fact that GOJEK itself was\nrapidly evolving, making it difficult for the team to figure out which services\nshould be transitioned and which would soon be deprecated, and the job became\nmore complex. As Trifecta PM Sourabh Gupta puts it:\n\n> “It was like changing wheels on a moving car.”\nWhile the main team focussed on transforming existing services and mobile\narchitecture to build a working POC, a parallel team undertook the long and\npainful journey to understand inter-service dependencies that would need to be\ntackled.\n\nIronically, they were themselves depending on multiple GOJEK product teams to\nunderstand the dependencies of over 400 microservices. This was crucial in order\nto chart out a plan for automating the deployments and cluster creation.\n\nHours turned into days…\n\nDocumentation was scarce, and the team had to undertake the painstaking process\nof talking to service owners, and map out configurations. This also meant many\nGOJEK team members had to take time out of their daily routines to spend on\nknowledge transfer.\n\nIdentify, document, dismantle, develop. Over and over.\n\nAn emergence. A transformation.\nIt took some doing, but finally, there was a glimmer at the end of the tunnel.\nTrifecta emerged into the light of a new day with a finished POC. A relatively\ncomplete driver and consumer app that were worthy of upload to the Play store.\n\nThe deadline the team had given itself was three months.\n\nIt had only taken two-and-a-half.\n\nTrifecta’s eight-member crack team had accomplished what it set out to do, and\nbuilt a working POC. Their role in this journey was at an end, and so they\ndisbanded and went back to their product teams. The original fellowship was no\nmore.\n\n> The team working on dependencies however, was facing rough weather.\nSifting through those 100s of microservices was taking longer than expected, and\nthe knowledge transfer meetings were slowly losing attendance. Progress was\nimbalanced, and the parallel approach was not yielding results. There was only\none move that made sense: absorb the engineers into the core Trifecta team.\n\n> The birth of a new party for the next stage of the journey.\nThe constitution of the team had changed, but the goal remained the same. The\nfirst months of 2018 saw Trifecta work tirelessly to untangle the intricate\ndependency map of GOJEK’s microservices. The process was tedious, but it did\nhave a silver lining. We now had a ton of documentation about GOJEK’s product\nand service architecture — a path had been cut through the woods for others on\nsimilar journeys.\n\nFinally, a clear picture emerged.\n\nIt… looked a little like this:\n\nMonths of work, depicted in a single image. Complicated as it looks, this was a\nmajor breakthrough. The key to the codex.\n\nInitially, it was estimated that in order to launch with two key products\n(GO-RIDE and GO-SEND) GOJEK would need to deploy 40 microservices for the new\nclusters. With each new dependency unearthed, that number kept inflating.\nIntegration of GO-PAY services (which were required for maintaining a driver\nwallet, and to handle incentives and subsidies) brought its own set of\ncomplexities, as its services and tech architecture was modelled differently\nfrom the rest of GOJEK.\n\nAs the launch timeline drew closer, there were over 100 microservices to deploy.\nNot an easy task, but the team finally knew what needed to be done.\n\nThe fog of war was finally parting. Now, to build a working environment.\n\nGunning for the finish line\nThe work on automation and deployment scripts now continued as originally\nplanned. The wheels were in motion again, and passing through terrain GOJEK knew\nwell. It was time to build stuff.\n\nOpsTech, Transport, GO-SEND, Marketplace, Driver Platform, GO-PAY and Platform\nteams provided backup, and the products for Vietnam launch were developed (we\nwould launch with GO-RIDE and GO-SEND). The team was working efficiently, and as\nthe cool grip of winter began to give way to the warm summer months, a basic\nenvironment was up for app development.\n\n> Then came the next wave of trouble.\nAs the environment took shape, our inexperience in dealing with new geographies\ncame back to haunt us. Configuration mismatch across clusters and deployment\ndrift reared their heads. Suddenly, there were more questions that needed\nanswering:\n\n> 1.Where would we manage configuration of services for all the new markets?\n> 2. How would we deploy on containers and ensure that the same version of code\nwas running on all environments?\n> 3. What about logging and monitoring?\nThe goal seemed an eternity away, again.\n\nChaos ensued.\n\nFor the continued story of how GOJEK grappled with the challenges brought on by\na new geography, read part 2 [http://bit.ly/2Rm2cSC] of this 3 part series.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWant our updates beamed straight to your inbox?

The 103-minute documentary didn’t release in a single\ntheatre.\n\nMore than 40% of viewers saw the movie on… wait for it… WeChat.\n\nWith more than a billion\n[https://www.statista.com/statistics/255778/number-of-active-wechat-messenger-accounts/] \n(Billion with a B ?) monthly active users, WeChat is the sort of phenomenon\nthat hasn’t been replicated anywhere else in the world. Till now. But more on\nthat later.\n\nWeChat is more than just an ‘app’ on a smartphone. Tencent, its parent company,\nhas unbundled the traditional desktop OS, or at least our idea of one. It’s one\napp for media sharing, social media, movie bookings (the irony?), taxi-hailing,\npayments, video calls, commerce and more. It also has its own Slack-like\ncorporate account. Hell, even government agencies use WeChat.\n\nUsers check the app at least 10 times a day on an average, and more than 80% of\nusers purchase products online. That kind of stickiness at such scale is\nunprecedented.\n\nIt’s not really an app as much as an Operating System for smartphones. WeChat is\na Super App.\n\nWhat makes for a Super App?\nIn 2010 [http://devblog.blackberry.com/2010/02/what-is-a-super-app/], Mike\nLazaridis, the Founder of Blackberry, took a stab at what a ‘Super App’\nconstitutes, “…representing a new class of mobile applications that make you\nwonder how you ever lived without them.” Lazaridis’ definition was a closed\necosystem of “many apps” that people would use everyday “…because they offer\nsuch a seamless, integrated, contextualised and efficient experience”.\nBlackberry, as you know, got unbundled because they charged the user to be on a\n‘platform’, without adding services to the platform. By building a walled\ngarden, the brand alienated its users.\n\nA Super App is many apps within an umbrella app. It’s an OS that unbundles the\ntyranny of apps. It’s the portal to the Internet for a mobile-first generation.\n\nMore often than not, it will likely be operate at the intersection of\nlogistics/hyper-local delivery, commerce, payments and social. To become a Super\nApp, you need at least two of these functions. The idea is to scale fast once\nyou have a user’s buy-in, and add multiple services to gain loyalty.\n\nOnce you have direct offerings, the next logical step is to open the app up to\nthird-party companies to build on a loyal user base. Now, you don’t build\nseparate apps. Instead, you can host your offerings on a single Super App.\nStep-by-step, the Super App becomes the OS.\n\nIn that context, there are a rare few who have what it takes to build a new-age,\nmobile-first OS that can be categorised as a Super App.\n\nSay hi to GOJEK*.\n\nWhat makes Gojek a Super App\nGojek is one app for ordering food, commuting, digital payments, shopping,\nhyper-local delivery, getting a massage, and two dozen services. It’s\nIndonesia’s first and fastest growing unicorn, building an on-demand empire.\nGojek runs the equivalent of three Indian unicorns rolled into one.\n\nMeet... the #SuperAppWith more than 125+ million app downloads, and total order\nvolumes growing 6600x in 36 months, Gojek already has 18+ products. Every year,\nthe company adds more ammunition to its arsenal. It’s the only hyper-growth\nstartup in the world from a developing country. One app, many use cases. Gojek\nis a #SuperApp.\n\nBut why a #SuperApp?\nBy removing clutter from a smartphone OS and its multiple apps, UX acts as a\nbait to get the next billion on a smartphone. Design becomes a language for the\nuninitiated. But among a dozen reasons why, here’s the most hilarious one:\n\nRemember India’s ‘Good Morning’ message phenomenon? Every day, India’s mobile\nusers send a ‘good morning’ image to their friends and family. According to a\nWSJ report\n[https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-internet-is-filling-up-because-indians-are-sending-millions-of-good-morning-texts-1516640068]\n, “These images have an overabundance of sun-dappled flowers, adorable toddlers,\nbirds and sunsets sent along with a cheery message.” As a result, one in three\nsmartphone users ran out of space daily, according to a Western Digital report.\n\nAnd the first thing they do to free up space is… delete apps.\n\nBut it’s not about space constraints anymore (that’s a thing of the past) — it’s\nabout breaking design language barriers so more baby boomers and the next\nbillion users can participate in the Internet economy.\n\nIn a nation of 1.3+ billion people, a little over a third of India has access to\nthe internet.\n\nIndia ranks well below the global average for mobile connectivity in the world.\nMobile broadband connectivity is only slightly better than Kenya.\n\nA Statista report\n[https://www.statista.com/statistics/276623/number-of-apps-available-in-leading-app-stores/] \nshows there are over four million apps available between just the Google Play\nstore and the Apple App Store, and the glut is painful for countries with\nlimited smartphone memory and a saturated market. A Super App corrects this\nimbalance. It sits on top of a mobile OS by shrinking the time taken to complete\na specific task and in turn, increase productivity.

The 103-minute documentary didn’t release in a single theatre.</p><p><em><em>More than 40% of viewers saw the movie on… wait for it… <strong><strong>WeChat.</strong></strong></em></em></p><p>With more than a <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/255778/number-of-active-wechat-messenger-accounts/\" rel=\"noopener\">billion</a> (Billion with a B ?)<strong><strong> monthly active users</strong></strong>, WeChat is the sort of phenomenon that hasn’t been replicated anywhere else in the world. Till now. But more on that later.</p><p>WeChat is more than just an ‘app’ on a smartphone. Tencent, its parent company, has unbundled the traditional desktop OS, or at least our idea of one. It’s one app for media sharing, social media, movie bookings (the irony?), taxi-hailing, payments, video calls, commerce and more. It also has its own Slack-like corporate account. Hell, even government agencies use WeChat.</p><p>Users check the app at least 10 times a day on an average, and more than 80% of users purchase products online. That kind of stickiness at such scale is unprecedented.</p><p>It’s not really an app as much as an Operating System for smartphones. WeChat is a Super App.</p><h1 id=\"what-makes-for-a-super-app\">What makes for a Super App?</h1><p>In <a href=\"http://devblog.blackberry.com/2010/02/what-is-a-super-app/\" rel=\"noopener\">2010</a>, Mike Lazaridis, the Founder of Blackberry, took a stab at what a ‘Super App’ constitutes, “…representing a new class of mobile applications that make you wonder how you ever lived without them.” Lazaridis’ definition was a closed ecosystem of “many apps” that people would use everyday “…because they offer such a seamless, integrated, contextualised and efficient experience”. Blackberry, as you know, got unbundled because they charged the user to be on a ‘platform’, without adding services to the platform. <strong><strong>By building a walled garden, the brand alienated its users.</strong></strong></p><p><em><em>A Super App is many apps within an umbrella app. It’s an OS that unbundles the tyranny of apps. It’s the portal to the Internet for a mobile-first generation.</em></em></p><p>More often than not, it will likely be operate at the intersection of logistics/hyper-local delivery, commerce, payments and social. To become a Super App, you need at least two of these functions. The idea is to scale fast once you have a user’s buy-in, and add multiple services to gain loyalty.</p><p>Once you have direct offerings, the next logical step is to open the app up to third-party companies to build on a loyal user base. Now, you don’t build separate apps. Instead, you can host your offerings on a single Super App. Step-by-step, the Super App becomes the OS.</p><p>In that context, there are a rare few who have what it takes to build a new-age, mobile-first OS that can be categorised as a Super App.</p><p><strong><strong>Say hi to GOJEK*.</strong></strong></p><h1 id=\"what-makes-gojek-a-super-app\">What makes Gojek a Super App</h1><p>Gojek is one app for ordering food, commuting, digital payments, shopping, hyper-local delivery, getting a massage, and two dozen services. It’s Indonesia’s first and fastest growing unicorn, building an on-demand empire. Gojek runs the equivalent of three Indian unicorns rolled into one.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card kg-card-hascaption\"><iframe width=\"480\" height=\"270\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Tn4MGnTkF8c?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe><figcaption>Meet... the #SuperApp</figcaption></figure><p>With more than 125+ million app downloads, and total order volumes growing 6600x in 36 months, Gojek already has 18+ products. Every year, the company adds more ammunition to its arsenal. It’s the only hyper-growth startup in the world from a developing country. One app, many use cases. Gojek is a #SuperApp.</p><h1 id=\"but-why-a-superapp\">But why a #SuperApp?</h1><p>By removing clutter from a smartphone OS and its multiple apps, UX acts as a bait to get the <em><em>next billion</em></em> on a smartphone. <strong><strong>Design becomes a language</strong></strong> for the uninitiated. But among a dozen reasons why, here’s the most hilarious one:</p><p>Remember India’s ‘Good Morning’ message phenomenon? Every day, India’s mobile users send a ‘good morning’ image to their friends and family. According to a WSJ <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-internet-is-filling-up-because-indians-are-sending-millions-of-good-morning-texts-1516640068\" rel=\"noopener\">report</a>, “These images have an overabundance of sun-dappled flowers, adorable toddlers, birds and sunsets sent along with a cheery message.” As a result, one in three smartphone users ran out of space daily, according to a Western Digital report.</p><p>And the first thing they do to free up space is… <strong>delete apps.</strong></p><p>But it’s not about space constraints anymore (that’s a thing of the past) — it’s about breaking design language barriers so more baby boomers and the next billion users can participate in the Internet economy.</p><p><em><em>In a nation of 1.3+ billion people, a little over a third of India has access to the internet.</em></em></p><p>India ranks well below the global average for mobile connectivity in the world. Mobile broadband connectivity is only slightly better than Kenya.</p><p>A Statista <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/276623/number-of-apps-available-in-leading-app-stores/\" rel=\"noopener\">report</a> shows there are over four million apps available between just the Google Play store and the Apple App Store, and the glut is painful for countries with limited smartphone memory and a saturated market. <strong><strong>A</strong></strong> <strong><strong>Super App corrects this imbalance.</strong></strong> It sits on top of a mobile OS by shrinking the time taken to complete a specific task and in turn, increase productivity. For the next billion users, it also adds UX elements that make it easier for users to get accustomed to mobile phone usage.</p><p>Is it easy? No. Ask Facebook.

And just when you think it’s done, there’s another layer. For\nthe next 3 months, it was onion after onion, layer after layer across teams at\nGOJEK. Downtimes were the new normal by the beginning of 2016.\n\nBack to square one.\n\nThe ‘Broadcast algorithm’ the bid engine team was relying on was failing. But\nhow?\n\nEvery driver was seeing the same order multiple times. The algorithm\n‘broadcasted’ the same order across its driver database. So if there were 100\norders in a specific area and 200 drivers, each driver would see the order, but\nnot necessarily be able to fulfil it. There was a three-fold problem to the\nalgorithm: Accountability, High-concurrency and promoting Unhealthy competition.\n\nAccountability: How can we reward the drivers who are doing more orders, zero\ncancellations etc… when he/she simply couldn’t accept the order? How can we deny\nbonus, because by design, a driver was not getting an order due to a dozen\nreasons? There was no accountability for the driver, or the business\nfundamentals.\n\nHigh-concurrency: The sheer volume of orders meant drivers were missing out on\norders because it was blasted across phones. Some orders were not being\nfulfilled because of multiple blasts and server loads. More orders, less drivers\n= some orders not being fulfilled, which resulted in a poor customer experience.\n\nNote: The location-based orders are a peculiar problem for GOJEK.\n\n> Why? In a distance of 20metres, you’ll spot more than 30+ GO-RIDE scooters, as\nopposed to maybe a maximum of 10 cars.\nUnhealthy competition: Once you’re blasting an order to all, you’re not\nfactoring in quality drivers for customers. We were also not getting the nearest\ndriver for an order. This breeds unhealthy competitiveness among drivers.\n\nThere is an adequate probability of doubt in the nature the algorithm was\ndesigned, and other constraints that are outside of the realm. Who gets the\norder became a function of the phone — better GPS, hardware, Internet, software;\nall played a critical portion. And that was unfair. So zero accountability and\nhigh congestion of drivers meant things were going awry.\n\n10x growth, 100% failure\nWhen Niranjan [https://twitter.com/niranjan_p] pulled a couple of all nighters\n[https://blog.gojekengineering.com/how-go-jek-manages-1-million-drivers-with-12-engineers-part-1-978af9ccfd32] \nand and rewrote the code, the core portion was rewritten to make it a SPIKE.\nWhat is a spike? You break the rules and throw caution to the air with the\nobjective of shipping something out to keep the company afloat. The problem with\nSPIKE is that it wasn’t the end-solution. And that meant more downtimes and more\nfailures. But, the team was in murky waters by late 2015.\n\nAt this point, GOJEK was managing 300,000+ orders every day. Failures were\nroutine. Again. Wherever Nadiem went, he was questioned on why the app was\ncrashing or users could simply not find customers. At this point, the tech team\nwas made up of around 10 people, who were firefighting every day. When Shobhit\n[https://medium.com/u/e5f92a17704d?source=post_page-----35f6a27a0faf----------------------]\n, one of our star programmers, went to a Domino’s store nearby to grab a quick\nbite, drivers started questioning him. Anyone who wore a GOJEK T-shirt became\nthe unofficial complaint box. Something needed to change, and fast.\n\nThis was again an underestimation of how much Indonesians relied on GOJEK.\nEveryone wanted to use GOJEK. It made life easier in the traffic-congested glut\nthat was Indonesia. Importantly, jobs and lives depended on it.\n\nDecisions…\n\nNadiem’s internal mail> “No project has a budget and impact as big as this in\nGOJEK’s history”\nThe big rewrite — The Perfect Allocation\nThe team needed to work on a different algorithm: 1–1 personalisation, pin\naccountability on drivers, identify what a perfect driver looks like, and ideate\non how to frame this persona. The big rewrite began in the middle of 2016. The\n‘bid engine’ team was now rechristened as the ‘Allocations’ team. At this point,\nwe were still losing customers. There were leaky faucets that were not sealed.\nAfter all, the work of the Allocations team criss-crossed all of GOJEK’s\nproducts and services. It was time to revisit the mothership.\n\nHello Clojure.\n\nBack to square one. Back to taking risks. By now, the core team was all too\nfamiliar with handling high-pressure timelines and live codebases. Clojure was\nan obvious choice because of the specific complexities it intended to solve.\n\n> “Only two in the team knew Clojure then, but it solved an important business\nproblem. We went with it and we all had to learn. Back to school. Again.” — \nNiranjan Paranjape\n[https://medium.com/u/689ebe477c46?source=post_page-----35f6a27a0faf----------------------]\nThe first task was to replicate the bid engine logic. A 6-member team got to\nwork with Clojure. Why Clojure? Because the language designs better abstractions\nfor a specific problem the team needed to solve. While Golang was the modern\nsuperbike that had it all, Clojure was the cruiser — really simple and capable\nof designing complex code. Clojure ushered this idea of getting organised and\nensuring good software development practices.\n\nOn the left, you see the Allocation code in Go. On the right, the exact same\ncode in Clojure.\n\nThis is not to state one language is better than the other. It’s tempting to\narrive at that conclusion when you see the image above. There were trade-offs\nmade when the switch was made. While Go is superior in performance, the\ncapability to make changes and add features was hard. Language was traded for\ndesign.\n\nThe innate abstraction to sniff out what works when, how and why is what makes\nlean engineering so special at GOJEK.\n\n“The more boring a rewrite is, the sweeter the success,” — Shobhit\n[https://medium.com/u/e5f92a17704d?source=post_page-----35f6a27a0faf----------------------]\n. After the 2-month long big rewrite, a stable product was live. Pause. Breathe.\nAfter 3 days of releasing, no one noticed there was a new codebase/algorithm in\nplace. That’s what success tastes like. Smooth as butter. No issues and\nachieving scale.\n\nShaping a mindset\nThat’s half the story told. A million mistakes later, we’re still making\nmistakes. But that’s the good part. We fail fast. We build fast. No hierarchy. \nThere’s an ingrained mentality of managing more with less. Anything that’s\nrepetitive gets automated. One could argue this was born out of the desperation\nof GOJEK products being the arteries criss-crossing through the heart of\nIndonesia. Regardless, the engineering psyche was passed down and filters\nthrough our recruitment. Here’s a reckoner on why GOJEK is hard to get into and\nequally hard to abandon.\n[https://medium.com/gojekengineering/why-we-ask-for-code-b276b45ea790]\n\nThe simplification of the story would merely state the Allocation team allocates\ndrivers to customers. But their genesis is filled with fascinating engineering\ninsights. How do you factor supply and demand, how do you reward drivers, manage\ndriver health by reducing the workload, figure surge pricing, check for\nloopholes, and so on. Each function has dozens of people in similar startups at\nGOJEK’s scale. We are able to cut this down because of our emphasis on lean\nengineering. We don’t make compromises on our recruitment either. Leaders code.\nEveryone codes.\n\nEngineers are running their own startups in a startup. GOJEK is creating a one\nof a kind Super App with a platform for other startups to be part of\n\nToday, anyone within a 300-meter range can grab a ride. That’s only an average.\nIn popular malls near Jakarta, there are drivers every 10 metres or lesser. Then\ncame dashboards and data to crunch driver statistics, daily research to tweak\nthe algorithm. The last time I checked, GOJEK does more than 35+ orders each\nsecond across our services like GO-FOOD, GO-SEND, GO-MASSAGE etc…\n\nThe ship of Theseus\nYou use a really old car to commute to office. It breaks, stutters and sometimes\nrefuses to move entirely. You can’t scrap it because it’s the only car you have.\nBut you want a supercar. So you go about buying the steering wheel and fixing it\nto the old car. Then comes the rims, the music system, leather seats and slowly,\nthe car begins to take shape. But it still has components of nostalgia; the car\nthat ferried you in dark times when nothing else would. Stan Marsh is that old\ncar.\n\nRemember Stan Marsh? The old legacy code on which GOJEK was being built?\n\n10% of Stan Marsh survives. Even till date. (There is a plan to eventually put\nit to bed [https://blog.gojekengineering.com/thank-you-stan-marsh-29db553544bf])\nIt’s there for legacy reasons. I suspect the team is also sentimental about it.\nThink of it as the ‘Ship of Theseus’ conundrum. No matter what engineers who\njoin GOJEK think of Stan Marsh, it was the foundation on which GOJEK was built.\nSmart engineering is also about working with a legacy codebase and improving it.\nFly with what you have and make it better. Everything else will follow. The team\nembraced that challenge.\n\nIt all boils down to the kind of people you let in the system. People are\nempowered to make decisions at GOJEK. As our India Head, Sidu Ponnappa\n[https://medium.com/u/e2e244e6c6b3?source=post_page-----35f6a27a0faf----------------------] \noften repeats, “Don’t throw people at a problem.” It’s a typical outsourcing\nmindset Indian Engineers have been cajoled into. More people does not mean\nbetter work. More people does not mean better code. If that were true, GOJEK\nsimply wouldn’t exist today doing more than a 100 million+ orders a month with a\npaltry 200+ engineers.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nStory credits: Shobhit Srivastava\n[https://medium.com/u/e5f92a17704d?source=post_page-----35f6a27a0faf----------------------]\n, Ranjeet Singh\n[https://medium.com/u/710d3b419a5a?source=post_page-----35f6a27a0faf----------------------]\n, Mehakdeep Singh\n[https://medium.com/u/36ce12a82c52?source=post_page-----35f6a27a0faf----------------------]\n, Bergas Bimo Branarto\n[https://medium.com/u/5cffcceadf08?source=post_page-----35f6a27a0faf----------------------]\n.","html":"<p>By Adithya Venkatesan</p><p>This is Part 2 of a feature story profiling the ‘Allocations’ team at GOJEK.

Language was traded for design.</p><p><em><em>The innate abstraction to sniff out what works when, how and why is what makes lean engineering so special at GOJEK.</em></em></p><p>“The more boring a rewrite is, the sweeter the success,” — <a href=\"https://medium.com/u/e5f92a17704d?source=post_page-----35f6a27a0faf----------------------\" rel=\"noopener\">Shobhit</a>. After the 2-month long big rewrite, a stable product was live. Pause. Breathe. After 3 days of releasing, no one noticed there was a new codebase/algorithm in place. That’s what success tastes like. Smooth as butter. No issues and achieving scale.</p><h1 id=\"shaping-a-mindset\">Shaping a mindset</h1><p>That’s half the story told. A million mistakes later, we’re still making mistakes. But that’s the good part. We fail fast. We build fast. No hierarchy. <strong><strong>There’s an ingrained mentality of managing more with less. Anything that’s repetitive gets automated</strong></strong>. One could argue this was born out of the desperation of GOJEK products being the arteries criss-crossing through the heart of Indonesia. Regardless, the engineering psyche was passed down and filters through our recruitment. Here’s a reckoner on <a href=\"https://medium.com/gojekengineering/why-we-ask-for-code-b276b45ea790\" rel=\"noopener\">why GOJEK is hard to get into and equally hard to abandon.</a></p><p>The simplification of the story would merely state the Allocation team allocates drivers to customers. But their genesis is filled with fascinating engineering insights. How do you factor supply and demand, how do you reward drivers, manage driver health by reducing the workload, figure surge pricing, check for loopholes, and so on. Each function has dozens of people in similar startups at GOJEK’s scale. We are able to cut this down because of our emphasis on lean engineering. We don’t make compromises on our recruitment either. Leaders code. Everyone codes.</p><p>Engineers are running their own startups in a startup. GOJEK is creating a one of a kind Super App with a platform for other startups to be part of</p><p>Today, anyone within a 300-meter range can grab a ride. That’s only an average. In popular malls near Jakarta, there are drivers every 10 metres or lesser. Then came dashboards and data to crunch driver statistics, daily research to tweak the algorithm. The last time I checked, GOJEK does more than 35+ orders <strong><strong>each second</strong></strong> across our services like GO-FOOD, GO-SEND, GO-MASSAGE etc…</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1200/1*uIDXYaHyIQzvhtIHRThNWA.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><h1 id=\"the-ship-of-theseus\">The ship of Theseus</h1><p>You use a really old car to commute to office. It breaks, stutters and sometimes refuses to move entirely. You can’t scrap it because it’s the only car you have. But you want a supercar. So you go about buying the steering wheel and fixing it to the old car. Then comes the rims, the music system, leather seats and slowly, the car begins to take shape. But it still has components of nostalgia; the car that ferried you in dark times when nothing else would. Stan Marsh is that old car.</p><p><em><em>Remember Stan Marsh? The old legacy code on which GOJEK was being built?</em></em></p><p>10% of Stan Marsh survives. Even till date. (<a href=\"https://blog.gojekengineering.com/thank-you-stan-marsh-29db553544bf\" rel=\"noopener\">There is a plan to eventually put it to bed</a>) It’s there for legacy reasons. I suspect the team is also sentimental about it. Think of it as the ‘Ship of Theseus’ conundrum. No matter what engineers who join GOJEK think of Stan Marsh, it was the foundation on which GOJEK was built. Smart engineering is also about working with a legacy codebase and improving it. Fly with what you have and make it better. Everything else will follow. The team embraced that challenge.</p><p>It all boils down to the kind of people you let in the system. People are empowered to make decisions at GOJEK. As our India Head, <a href=\"https://medium.com/u/e2e244e6c6b3?source=post_page-----35f6a27a0faf----------------------\" rel=\"noopener\">Sidu Ponnappa</a> often repeats, “Don’t throw people at a problem.” It’s a typical outsourcing mindset Indian Engineers have been cajoled into. More people does not mean better work. More people does not mean better code. If that were true, GOJEK simply wouldn’t exist today doing more than a 100 million+ orders a month with a paltry 200+ engineers.</p><hr><p>Story credits: <a href=\"https://medium.com/u/e5f92a17704d?source=post_page-----35f6a27a0faf----------------------\" rel=\"noopener\">Shobhit Srivastava</a>, <a href=\"https://medium.com/u/710d3b419a5a?source=post_page-----35f6a27a0faf----------------------\" rel=\"noopener\">Ranjeet Singh</a>, <a href=\"https://medium.com/u/36ce12a82c52?source=post_page-----35f6a27a0faf----------------------\" rel=\"noopener\">Mehakdeep Singh</a>, <a href=\"https://medium.com/u/5cffcceadf08?source=post_page-----35f6a27a0faf----------------------\" rel=\"noopener\">Bergas Bimo Branarto</a>.</p>","url":"https://gojek-ghost.zysk.in/how-gojek-manages-1-million-drivers-with-12-engineers-part-2/","canonical_url":null,"uuid":"b71c3dd0-28bd-4805-8af7-6071c17748f3","page":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_styles":null,"comment_id":"5eb12c67f7c7da001effcdd8","reading_time":7}},{"node":{"id":"Ghost__Post__5eb12b71f7c7da001effcdbe","title":"How Gojek Manages 1 million Drivers With 12 Engineers (Part 1)","slug":"how-gojek-manages-1-million-drivers-with-12-engineers-part-1","featured":true,"feature_image":"https://res-3.cloudinary.com/hcq4cvthp/image/upload/q_auto/v1/ghost-blog-images/1_0G01nMPD--K_MrKhhkurtw.jpg","excerpt":"The story of GOJEK’s first ever team, and consequently, the psyche of how 200 engineers run a Super App of 18+ products.","custom_excerpt":"The story of GOJEK’s first ever team, and consequently, the psyche of how 200 engineers run a Super App of 18+ products.","visibility":"public","created_at_pretty":"05 May, 2020","published_at_pretty":"24 May, 2018","updated_at_pretty":"12 May, 2020","created_at":"2020-05-05T14:31:37.000+05:30","published_at":"2018-05-24T09:30:00.000+05:30","updated_at":"2020-05-12T11:57:36.000+05:30","meta_title":null,"meta_description":"The story of GOJEK’s first ever team, and consequently, the psyche of how 200 engineers run a Super App of 18+ products.","og_description":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"authors":[{"name":"Gojek","slug":"gojek","bio":"Gojek is a Super App. It’s one app for ordering food, commuting, digital payments, shopping, hyper-local delivery, and two dozen services.","profile_image":"https://gojek-ghost.zysk.in/content/images/2020/05/logo-01-1.png","twitter":"@gojektech","facebook":"gojektech","website":"https://www.gojek.io"}],"primary_author":{"name":"Gojek","slug":"gojek","bio":"Gojek is a Super App. It’s one app for ordering food, commuting, digital payments, shopping, hyper-local delivery, and two dozen services.","profile_image":"https://gojek-ghost.zysk.in/content/images/2020/05/logo-01-1.png","twitter":"@gojektech","facebook":"gojektech","website":"https://www.gojek.io"},"primary_tag":{"name":"Stories","slug":"stories","description":"Deep dives into high-impact initiatives and products that helped Gojek create significant impact.","feature_image":null,"meta_description":null,"meta_title":null,"visibility":"public"},"tags":[{"name":"Stories","slug":"stories","description":"Deep dives into high-impact initiatives and products that helped Gojek create significant impact.","feature_image":null,"meta_description":null,"meta_title":null,"visibility":"public"}],"plaintext":"By Adithya Venkatesan\n\nIn Norse mythology, Yggdrasil is a gigantic mythical tree that connects the nine\nworlds of Norse cosmology.
