As we spread out from Jakarta,\nsatiating the hunger of millions of customers in most parts of Indonesia, GoFood\nas a product got increasingly complicated. Orders started to pile up, and we\nwere struggling to keep up with the skyrocketing demand. If we wanted to keep up\nwith users‚Äô expectations, a few things needed to be done. We had to change, and\nsimultaneously up our game.\n\nIt‚Äôs a VUCA world, and we often remind ourselves that not a lot of things are\nconstant. We‚Äôve been working hard to reimagine, re-engineer and redesign the\nGoFood flow which hasn‚Äôt been altered too much for many years.\n\nTo help you understand how it all started, let‚Äôs take you back in time a little\nbit‚Ä¶\n\nWhen the Gojek app for ride-hailing was launched in early 2015, we noticed there\nwere times when our driver partners had lean work periods. To provide additional\nmeans to help them make use of this time and earn more, GoSend (to send\ncouriers) and GoShop (to buy anything) were launched as auxiliary services.\n\n> We noticed that majority of orders placed in GoShop were for food. This gave way\nto GoFood, our dedicated food delivery product, launched in mid-2015.\nPhase 1: Listing Model\nGoFood started as a concierge model, where we had no tie-ups with restaurants. A\nSalesforce was deployed to list as many restaurant menus as possible on our\nplatform. When a customer placed an order, it would be assigned to one of our\ndriver partners, who would then go and place the order at the restaurant. The\ndriver partner would wait around, and when the order was ready, pay in cash,\npickup the order and deliver it to the customer.\n\nTedious? Yes. Scalable? No. ü§∑‚Äç\n\n\nPhase 2: Partnering With Merchants\nTo arrive at a scalable solution, we realised we had to take the restaurant\nmerchants along with us in this journey and welcome them into our ecosystem. We\nstarted partnering with the merchants, who were known as ‚ÄòGoFood Partners‚Äô.\n\n> This not only helped our merchants grow their businesses, but also got ample\nvisibility boost on GoFood.\nEven after onboarding them into our ecosystem, a large part of the process was\nmanual. It was far from ideal because there was no record of transactions\nbesides a booking on GoFood and a receipt handed to the driver partner.\n\nOften there were discrepancies in the number of orders assigned and the number\nof orders completed. How, you ask?\n\nImagine a GoFood partner who is part of a large chain of restaurants. When\nsomeone orders food from this chain, GoFood assigns this order to one outlet.\nHowever, the driver partner may decide to visit another outlet and pick up the\norder, as per convenience.\n\nThere were more problems galore.\n\nIf a merchant partner was not open for business on a particular day, and wanted\nto update their menu, or indicate items as out of stock, they had to call the\nGojek Customer Care. During this time, orders would still be coming in, which\nresulted in driver partners accepting orders that most certainly couldn‚Äôt be\ncompleted without a hassle.\n\nThere was a lot that needed fixing here, and it could only be done by\nintegrating merchants more deeply into our ecosystem. So, that‚Äôs exactly what we\ndid.\n\nPhase 3: The merchant app, GoResto\nTowards the end of 2016, a concept was developed for an app that would cater to\nmerchant partners, and by early 2017 GoResto (which is what we called it at the\ntime) was ready.\n\nWe introduced the following in GoResto:\n\n1. Electronic payments\nAll of Gojek‚Äôs driver partners had GoPay e-wallets associated with their\naccounts. With GoResto, we did the same for our GoFood partners. Transactions\nbetween driver and GoFood partners was directly wallet-to-wallet, hence,\ncashless.\n\n2. PIN exchange for restaurant verification\nTo ensure the order is secured, driver partners would also need to share a PIN\nwith the merchant while picking up the order. This electronic handshake helped\nus verify they were indeed picking up the right order from the right outlet.\n\n3. Catalog management\nWe noticed a lot of cancellations were happening because the items were either\nout of stock, restaurants were closed or customers were generally skeptical\nabout ordering dishes that didn‚Äôt have enough reference images. So, we started\nfocussing more on improving the product experience for our customers and BCR\n(booking completion rate). Catalog management was introduced so that the\nmerchants could regularly update details that customers saw on GoFood. For\nexample: Availability status of dishes that were put on the menu, uploading\ndetails pertaining to different items sold, etc.\n\nIn the meanwhile, GoResto was rebranded to GoBiz. What started off as a product\nthat helped merchants to manage their food orders, started evolving into\nsomething bigger. Since the scope extended beyond GoFood, calling it ‚ÄòGoResto‚Äô\nmade no sense.\n\nThe rebranding came with enhanced features in GoBiz. As you might‚Äôve guessed, it\nalso came with new, enhanced problems and a sub-optimal flow:\n\n‚ö†Ô∏è The driver partner was ready, but the food wasn‚Äôt\n> The average time taken for a driver partner was:\n~9 minutes to pick up an order\n~19 minutes to deliver the order\nA portion of this time was spent by the driver waiting for the food to be\nprepared, because in most cases, GoFood partners started preparing food only\nafter the driver arrived! This was mostly because customer would add more food\nitems or the ordered items would be out of stock. We figured that the driver\narrival time could be parallelised with the food prep time. This led to 2\nimportant things:\n\n * Overall delivery time for the customer could be reduced\n * Wait time for the driver could be utilised to fulfil other orders\n\nÔ∏èÔ∏èÔ∏è‚ö†Ô∏è GoFood Partner-driven cancellations existed, accountability didn‚Äôt\nGoFood partners had the ability to set their open hours and change item\navailability, but they didn‚Äôt always keep it updated. When cancellations\npertaining to these reasons happened, they were handled by‚Ä¶the driver partners.\nü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è\nThis meant, the orders had to be cancelled either by the driver partners or the\ncustomers themselves.\n\n> Items being out of stock or restaurants being closed accounted for over 35% of\nall customer cancellations after a driver was assigned.\nOn the driver side, these accounted for over 75% of all driver cancellations. üòì\n‚ö†Ô∏è Price edits became pricey\nIn this order flow, the driver placed the final order with the merchant. This\nessentially means that the original order placed by the customer could be\nmodified due to various reasons: Incorrect listing of price, unavailability of\nitems, adding new items to the order, etc. To accommodate these cases, drivers\nwere allowed to input to final price of the order, leading to a price edit.\n\nAnd price edits aren‚Äôt uncommon. They happen to ~34% of the orders.\n\nMultiple moving pieces exposed these orders to skip payments or consumer wallet\nsweeps.\n\nPhase 4: Introducing Merchant Acceptance Flow\nDue to various reasons, our driver partners were handling GoFood partner-driven\ncancellations and heavy-lifting to ensure the orders were fulfilled. This, too,\nhad to change.\n\nAfter brainstorming, mind-mapping and head-scratching, we arrived at Merchant\nAccept Flow (MAF). The merchants who are onboarded to MAF are called Super\nPartners. The solution lets our Super Partners accept/reject orders based on the\nrestaurant being open, availability of items, or any other factors that\ndetermine order fulfilment or cancellation. This in turn helps our customers and\ndriver partners know that the merchant is preparing food for sure, so that there\nare no customer or driver cancellations.\n\nIn Part-2 of this blog, we‚Äôll dive deep into Merchant Acceptance Flow, how we\nwent about designing it and introducing Super Partners to our customers.

The prices were too high and she\ncouldn‚Äôt afford them anymore.\nAs the operator of GoFood, one of the largest food delivery services in the\nworld, the wellbeing of merchant partners is paramount to us at Gojek. Many of\nour 400,000 partners, like Amalia, routinely encounter financial bottlenecks due\nto unexpected expenses or improper revenue management.\n\nFor a significant percentage of partners, bookkeeping is still a foreign\nconcept, with the order info provided by GoFood serving as their main marker for\nsales and revenue. They tend to go with the flow of the business, not planning\non scaling up or battening the hatches for a rainy day.\n\n> As another merchant partner puts it, ‚ÄúI never think much about money, I just\nleave it to the Almighty.‚Äù\nThe health of our business is only as good as the health of the businesses we\nwork with. So we embarked on a journey to help merchants with their capital woes\nby building a new financial service product.\n\nThis is how we built GoModal.\n\nTrials and tribulations\nWhen the going gets tough, merchant partners usually have three options: borrow\nfrom a relative, approach a bank, or cut down on living expenses.\n\nIn Indonesia, the idea of taking a pinjaman (loan) is still frowned upon. Even\nif the capital requirement is to help tide over a temporary crisis or business\nexpansion, merchants are hesitant to approach family for this reason. As many do\nnot possess solid credit scores, traditional bank loans are difficult to come by\nas well. This led to many partners pulling from savings and cutting down on\nexpenses ‚Äî forgoing even daily essentials to keep business going.\n\nThis wasn‚Äôt an experience we wanted our partners to have. Something had to be\ndone.\n\nGojek‚Äôs first attempt to solve this involved a tie-up with one of Indonesia‚Äôs\nlargest banks to offer our merchant partners subsidised business credit. While\nwe had the right idea, we had not solved the underlying issues ‚Äî partners would\nrarely pass the stringent disbursal criteria of a commercial bank, and disbursal\ntimelines would not suit their need for immediate capital.\n\n> In bad times, rapid capital infusion could make the difference between a\nbusiness sinking or floating.\nWe decided to try a different approach.\n\nWe‚Äôre in this together\nIn late 2018, we began offering working capital loans to our merchant partners.\nBy the next year, Gojek‚Äôs erstwhile merchant app, GoResto, had been overhauled\ninto GoBiz, a comprehensive Super App built to cater to all the needs of\nmerchant partners. In September 2019, we added our loan feature to GoBiz‚Äôs\nmerchant dashboard.\n\nWe called this Pinjaman Modal Usaha (PMU). In other words, a ‚Äòventure capital\nloan‚Äô.\n\nAs the payments of partners who had signed up for GoBiz was processed by us, we\ncould figure out their revenues and repayment capacity ourselves. This put Gojek\nin the perfect position to offer working capital, made collections simple, and\nfurther reinforced the trust partners had in us.\n\nThe capital need was slowly being addressed. The latter half of 2019 saw us\ndisburse capital to over 4,500 merchants. üôå\n\nBut one problem bothered us. We still weren‚Äôt fast enough.\n\nFrom pinjaman to modal\nWith PMU, Gojek had successfully addressed part of our partners‚Äô capital woes.\nBut PMU still relied on a rudimentary form to collect applications, tracking via\nspreadsheets, and manual approval processes.\n\n> The first step was a small one, automating parts of the verification and\nprocessing.\n> Next, we built out a complete credit cycle.\n> Then, we got rid of the spreadsheets.\nWe now had a complete product that could figure out how much capital could be\ngiven to which merchant, process applications almost instantly, and systems that\ncould handle disbursal and recovery.\n\nAs the final cherry (or strawberry üòâ) on top, we decided our improved product\ncould use an improved name. A Gojek name.\n\nRemember the negative connotation associated with the word pinjaman? We weren‚Äôt\ngiving our partners loans. We were giving them capital. Modal.\n\nAnd so was a new product born ‚Äî GoModal.\n\nWhat does it do?\nNow that we had a product that could do everything we envisioned, it was time to\nget it out front and centre. Not a lot of merchants manually accessed the GoBiz\ndashboard, so in January 2020, we put GoModal in a place where we sure everyone\nwould see it.\n\nThe GoBiz app.\n\nUsing GoModal, eligible merchant partners can avail pre-approved working capital\nbetween Rp1.5m ($90) to Rp150m ($9,000) with repayment tenures ranging from 2 to\n12 months.\n\nRemember we mentioned we could now disburse capital faster?\n\n> Relying on a bank for capital leads to processing time of up to 6 weeks. With\nGoModal, we get money to the bank accounts of our partners in 13 hours. üí™\nSince our partners are now busy fighting fires and expanding business, we\nfigured it wasn‚Äôt fair to hassle them with big monthly repayments. As their\nearnings are processed by GoBiz, we deduct payments from their daily earnings up\nto 20 days a month, assuming they generated enough revenue.\n\nGoFood is built by the grit and ingenuity of our partner merchants, and running\na business is hard enough without having to constantly worry about capital.\nThat‚Äôs why we went on the journey to build GoModal.\n\nSo people like Amalia never have to worry about buying strawberries again.\n\nWant more of content like this?

So we embarked on a journey to help merchants with their capital woes by building a new financial service product.</p><p>This is how we built GoModal.</p><h3 id=\"trials-and-tribulations\">Trials and tribulations</h3><p>When the going gets tough, merchant partners usually have three options: borrow from a relative, approach a bank, or cut down on living expenses.</p><p>In Indonesia, the idea of taking a <em><em>pinjaman</em></em> (loan) is still frowned upon. Even if the capital requirement is to help tide over a temporary crisis or business expansion, merchants are hesitant to approach family for this reason. As many do not possess solid credit scores, traditional bank loans are difficult to come by as well. This led to many partners pulling from savings and cutting down on expenses ‚Äî forgoing even daily essentials to keep business going.</p><p><strong><strong>This wasn‚Äôt an experience we wanted our partners to have. Something had to be done.</strong></strong></p><p>Gojek‚Äôs first attempt to solve this involved a tie-up with one of Indonesia‚Äôs largest banks to offer our merchant partners subsidised business credit. While we had the right idea, we had not solved the underlying issues ‚Äî partners would rarely pass the stringent disbursal criteria of a commercial bank, and disbursal timelines would not suit their need for immediate capital.</p><blockquote><em><em>In bad times, rapid capital infusion could make the difference between a business sinking or floating.</em></em></blockquote><p>We decided to try a different approach.</p><h3 id=\"we-re-in-this-together\">We‚Äôre in this together</h3><p>In late 2018, we began offering working capital loans to our merchant partners. By the next year, Gojek‚Äôs erstwhile merchant app, GoResto, had been overhauled into GoBiz, a comprehensive Super App built to cater to all the needs of merchant partners. In September 2019, we added our loan feature to GoBiz‚Äôs merchant dashboard.</p><p>We called this <em><em>Pinjaman Modal Usaha</em></em> (PMU). In other words, a ‚Äòventure capital loan‚Äô.</p><p>As the payments of partners who had signed up for GoBiz was processed by us, we could figure out their revenues and repayment capacity ourselves. This put Gojek in the perfect position to offer working capital, made collections simple, and further reinforced the trust partners had in us.</p><p>The capital need was slowly being addressed. The latter half of 2019 saw us disburse capital to over 4,500 merchants. üôå</p><p><em><em>But one problem bothered us. We still weren‚Äôt fast enough.</em></em></p><h3 id=\"from-pinjaman-to-modal\">From pinjaman to modal</h3><p>With PMU, Gojek had successfully addressed part of our partners‚Äô capital woes. But PMU still relied on a rudimentary form to collect applications, tracking via spreadsheets, and manual approval processes.</p><blockquote><em><em>The first step was a small one, automating parts of the verification and processing.</em></em></blockquote><blockquote><em><em>Next, we built out a complete credit cycle.</em></em></blockquote><blockquote><em><em>Then, we got rid of the spreadsheets.</em></em></blockquote><p>We now had a complete product that could figure out how much capital could be given to which merchant, process applications almost instantly, and systems that could handle disbursal and recovery.</p><p>As the final cherry (or strawberry üòâ) on top, we decided our improved product could use an improved name. A Gojek name.</p><p>Remember the negative connotation associated with the word <em><em>pinjaman</em></em>? We weren‚Äôt giving our partners <em><em>loans</em></em>. We were giving them <em><em>capital</em></em>. <strong><strong>Modal</strong></strong>.</p><p>And so was a new product born ‚Äî GoModal.</p><h3 id=\"what-does-it-do\">What does it do?</h3><p>Now that we had a product that could do everything we envisioned, it was time to get it out front and centre. Not a lot of merchants manually accessed the GoBiz dashboard, so in January 2020, we put GoModal in a place where we sure everyone would see it.</p><p><strong><strong>The GoBiz app.</strong></strong></p><p>Using GoModal, eligible merchant partners can avail pre-approved working capital between Rp1.5m ($90) to Rp150m ($9,000) with repayment tenures ranging from 2 to 12 months.</p><p>Remember we mentioned we could now disburse capital faster?</p><blockquote>Relying on a bank for capital leads to processing time of up to 6 weeks. With GoModal, we get money to the bank accounts of our partners in 13 hours. üí™</blockquote><p>Since our partners are now busy fighting fires and expanding business, we figured it wasn‚Äôt fair to hassle them with big monthly repayments. As their earnings are processed by GoBiz, we deduct payments from their daily earnings up to 20 days a month, assuming they generated enough revenue.</p><p>GoFood is built by the grit and ingenuity of our partner merchants, and running a business is hard enough without having to constantly worry about capital. That‚Äôs why we went on the journey to build GoModal.</p><p>So people like Amalia never have to worry about buying strawberries again.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://gojek-ghost.zysk.in/content/images/2020/06/image-15.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>Want more of content like this? <a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/go-jek/gojek-tech-newsletter\" rel=\"noopener\">Sign up for our newsletter</a>!</p>","url":"https://gojek-ghost.zysk.in/helping-our-helpers-with-gomodal/","canonical_url":null,"uuid":"c9b06805-5e63-4c53-acc9-6fe01ed0a349","page":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_styles":null,"comment_id":"5ed9f3e47aa22c4066f8405b","reading_time":4}},{"node":{"id":"Ghost__Post__5ed9e2717aa22c4066f83fe8","title":"The Process Behind Program Management","slug":"the-process-behind-program-management","featured":false,"feature_image":"https://gojek-ghost.zysk.in/content/images/2020/06/ProcessProgramManagement.jpg","excerpt":"Using a Program Management and Agile approach to make deliverables skyrocket.","custom_excerpt":"Using a Program Management and Agile approach to make deliverables skyrocket.","visibility":"public","created_at_pretty":"05 June, 2020","published_at_pretty":"05 June, 2020","updated_at_pretty":"05 June, 2020","created_at":"2020-06-05T11:43:05.000+05:30","published_at":"2020-06-05T12:06:33.000+05:30","updated_at":"2020-06-05T13:07:06.000+05:30","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"og_description":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"authors":[{"name":"Gojek","slug":"gojek","bio":"Gojek is a Super App. It‚Äôs one app for ordering food, commuting, digital payments, shopping, hyper-local delivery, and two dozen services.","profile_image":"https://gojek-ghost.zysk.in/content/images/2020/05/logo-01-1.png","twitter":"@gojektech","facebook":"gojektech","website":"https://www.gojek.io"}],"primary_author":{"name":"Gojek","slug":"gojek","bio":"Gojek is a Super App. It‚Äôs one app for ordering food, commuting, digital payments, shopping, hyper-local delivery, and two dozen services.","profile_image":"https://gojek-ghost.zysk.in/content/images/2020/05/logo-01-1.png","twitter":"@gojektech","facebook":"gojektech","website":"https://www.gojek.io"},"primary_tag":{"name":"Tech","slug":"tech","description":"Learnings from technical challenges solved at Gojek, how-tos, and programming tips.","feature_image":null,"meta_description":null,"meta_title":null,"visibility":"public"},"tags":[{"name":"Tech","slug":"tech","description":"Learnings from technical challenges solved at Gojek, how-tos, and programming tips.","feature_image":null,"meta_description":null,"meta_title":null,"visibility":"public"},{"name":"Gojek","slug":"gojek","description":null,"feature_image":null,"meta_description":null,"meta_title":null,"visibility":"public"},{"name":"Program Management","slug":"program-management","description":null,"feature_image":null,"meta_description":null,"meta_title":null,"visibility":"public"},{"name":"Project Management","slug":"project-management","description":null,"feature_image":null,"meta_description":null,"meta_title":null,"visibility":"public"},{"name":"Scrum","slug":"scrum","description":null,"feature_image":null,"meta_description":null,"meta_title":null,"visibility":"public"}],"plaintext":"We‚Äôve often talked about how Gojek doesn‚Äôt build one Super App, it builds three.\nTo achieve this, multiple Product Development Groups (PDG) exist within Gojek.\nOne of these is the GoMerchants PDG, that handles all our merchant-centric\ninitiatives, including GoBiz, our SuperApp for merchant partners.\n\nGoMerchants is an entity formed by the fusion of multiple teams that all had\ntheir own work styles. How do such diverse people come together and build\namazing things? That‚Äôs where Program Management comes into the picture.\n\nThe Challenge\nGoMerchants PDG was formed from five separate teams (SPOTS, Midtrans, Mapan,\nGoResto, Nadipos), and each team had a unique engineering culture. Across teams,\nthe total number of staff involved in cross-functional work was ~240 people.\n\nAfter a discovery phase of the process over 3 months with the various groups, we\nfound that every team was utilising different versions of project management\nmethodology and tools to track team progress. Across various teams, we\nidentified nearly a dozen different types of tools and methods including the\nScrum method, Kanban method, Jira tools, Favro Tools, and Trello tools.\n\nThe key takeaway was clear: There was no single source of truth for tracking\nteam deployment progress.\n\nThe Solution\nTo achieve our goal of reaching a high rate of (quality) deliverables with clear\ntransparency on progress, the Program Managers decided to build a program that\nset a single standard workflow for everyone involved. The end result? A meld of\nAgile best practices and a limited/select set of tools.\n\nAt the highest level, Program Management methodology focuses on adding just \nenough processes to help with efficiency ‚Äî and not creating convoluted processes\nfor the sake of process. Keeping these best practices in mind, the workflow\nbuilt by the GoMerchants Program Management team entailed Scrum Process to track\nbacklog priority, using Confluence as a documentation hub, Jira for managing\nbacklog tasks, Pre-Iteration Planning Meetings, Sprint Planning, Daily Standups,\nand lastly, conducting regular Retrospectives.\n\nThe consolidated approach helped the GoMerchants team reach the rapid pace\nneeded to hit targeting of deliverables‚Äî but also helped support the team in an\nenvironment of rapidly-changing requirements via greater transparency.\n\nThere were additional benefits to this approach, as well: Instantaneous feedback\nfrom the team on what was working (and what was not), metrics to inform future\niterations of the workflow, and a reduction in deployment failure ‚Äî and rollback\ndeployment risk ‚Äî thanks to rapid and continuous internal communication.\n\n> ‚ÄúAgile software development is an approach to software development under which\nrequirements and solutions evolve through the collaborative effort of\nself-organizing and cross-functional teams and their customer(s)/end user(s).‚Äù ‚Äî\nCollier, Ken W.

The factors in selecting Jira were the platform functionality\nis highly-configurable to the specific requirements of a team, as well, as it\nhas the flexibility to allow for usage in a wide variety of environments and\nprocesses.\n\nScrum Activities\nBelow is the flow of scrum activity. It starts from Pre-Iteration Planning\nMeeting (Pre-IPM), Retrospective, IPM/Sprint Planning, and Daily Standup:\n\nSprints\nA Sprint is a time-box of iterations, where the releasable works that align with\nsprint goals are implemented. A Sprint always has a fixed start and end date ‚Äî\nthese dates should be of the same duration; typically two weeks.\n\nSource: Essential Scrum: A Practical Guide to the Most Popular Agile Process\nSprints notes: While most of GoMerchants PDG uses two-week sprints, the length\nof time can depend on several factors like the final deadline, number of people\nin the team, and holidays in the calendar. Some teams use a one-week Sprint\ncycle due to urgent work that requires moving at an accelerated pace. But,\ngenerally it is not a best practice to use one-week sprint cycles as team\nachievement moments can be missed, quality could be sacrificed, and team\nburn-out is a real risk.\n\nPre-I.P.M. (Pre-Iteration Planning Meeting)\nPre-IPM is an activity to review the active Sprint and manage backlog and Sprint\ngoal(s) for the next iteration. Pre-IPM is attended by a Product Manager, Tech\nLeads, and Program Manager. The Product Manager should write-up the ‚Äòstory‚Äô aka\nplan, in Jira after Pre-IPM. Tech lead should advise if the story and goals for\nthe next iteration are technically achievable.\n\nAs a Program Manager, you can use spreadsheets for mapping between the story and\nteam before doing the IPM. Below is the example:\n\nPre-IPM notes: This is basically a small meeting with a PM, TechLead, HoE/HoP\n(if necessary) and PgM. The purpose is to finalise the work backlog for the team\nin the upcoming Sprint. This meeting will help streamline the Sprint Planning\nmeeting by confirming that the final requirements have been aligned by all\nstakeholders ‚Äî the goal being to reduce the number of ‚ÄúRequirement Changes‚Äù\ngoing forward. .\n\nRetrospective\nThe purpose of a retrospective in IPM is to collect previous sprint feedback\nfrom the team. It contains some columns like:\n\n * Glad: What makes you happy in this sprint or things that went well\n * Sad: What makes you sad in this sprint and from here we can see how we can\n   improve it\n * Mad: What makes you mad or frustrated in this sprint\n * Ideas: Idea to improve our next sprint\n * Appreciation: Appreciation in this sprint, esp if there‚Äôs a pretty big team\n   achievement\n * Action Item: Action item to improve our next sprint based on Sad, Mad, and\n   Ideas columns. This is the important part to be followed up so ‚Äúlesson\n   learned‚Äù value from every sprint is really working\n\nWe can use several tools to help us collect data, i.e. https://funretro.io/,\nbelow is the example:\n\nSend a retrospective link to a Slack channel before IPM and encourage the team\nto fill the cards. Do the retrospective by talking through each column 15‚Äì30\nminutes before IPM starts.\n\nRetrospective notes: This session provides the opportunity for a team to look\nback and see how they can improve. Retrospectives can be a catalyst for\norganisational change, team change or even a culture change. The Retrospective\ncan be a place to build and enable teams, or to help teams start their journey\nwith a clear understanding of where to go next. It‚Äôs a method that is very\nuseful to gauge the Team Happiness state and gain Improvement Feedback from the\nteam. A Retrospective also builds trust and helps make the team grow stronger as\nindividual members know they have an outlet to express their feedback and they\nwill be heard by their managers and colleagues. Since this process is highly\nactionable, the PgM‚Äôs have incorporated it beyond the use case of small teams,\nand have instituted it at larger scale for the entire GoMerchants PDG Org every\n6 months.\n\nIPM/Sprint Planning\nIPM/Sprint Planning is an activity that is attended by all members of the team\nto prioritise the backlog, discuss stories, and determine story points.\n\nSource: http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1928232Below are the\nsteps taken in an IPM:\n\nBefore IPM:\n\n * Program Manager sends a retrospective link to a Slack channel\n\nDuring IPM:\n\n * Retrospective 15 min\n * Open Sprint Report to review active sprint (Done and Not Done)\n * Complete Sprint\n * Open velocity chart to review the commitment and complete stories from the\n   previous Sprint\n * Ask the team who will take a leave and discuss with PM about achievement\n   story (this will be helpful to adjust velocity for the next Sprint)\n * The PM explains each story for a new sprint.

As we spread out from Jakarta,\nsatiating the hunger of millions of customers in most parts of Indonesia, GoFood\nas a product got increasingly complicated. Orders started to pile up, and we\nwere struggling to keep up with the skyrocketing demand. If we wanted to keep up\nwith users‚Äô expectations, a few things needed to be done. We had to change, and\nsimultaneously up our game.\n\nIt‚Äôs a VUCA world, and we often remind ourselves that not a lot of things are\nconstant. We‚Äôve been working hard to reimagine, re-engineer and redesign the\nGoFood flow which hasn‚Äôt been altered too much for many years.\n\nTo help you understand how it all started, let‚Äôs take you back in time a little\nbit‚Ä¶\n\nWhen the Gojek app for ride-hailing was launched in early 2015, we noticed there\nwere times when our driver partners had lean work periods. To provide additional\nmeans to help them make use of this time and earn more, GoSend (to send\ncouriers) and GoShop (to buy anything) were launched as auxiliary services.\n\n> We noticed that majority of orders placed in GoShop were for food. This gave way\nto GoFood, our dedicated food delivery product, launched in mid-2015.\nPhase 1: Listing Model\nGoFood started as a concierge model, where we had no tie-ups with restaurants. A\nSalesforce was deployed to list as many restaurant menus as possible on our\nplatform. When a customer placed an order, it would be assigned to one of our\ndriver partners, who would then go and place the order at the restaurant. The\ndriver partner would wait around, and when the order was ready, pay in cash,\npickup the order and deliver it to the customer.\n\nTedious? Yes. Scalable? No. ü§∑‚Äç\n\n\nPhase 2: Partnering With Merchants\nTo arrive at a scalable solution, we realised we had to take the restaurant\nmerchants along with us in this journey and welcome them into our ecosystem. We\nstarted partnering with the merchants, who were known as ‚ÄòGoFood Partners‚Äô.\n\n> This not only helped our merchants grow their businesses, but also got ample\nvisibility boost on GoFood.\nEven after onboarding them into our ecosystem, a large part of the process was\nmanual. It was far from ideal because there was no record of transactions\nbesides a booking on GoFood and a receipt handed to the driver partner.\n\nOften there were discrepancies in the number of orders assigned and the number\nof orders completed. How, you ask?\n\nImagine a GoFood partner who is part of a large chain of restaurants. When\nsomeone orders food from this chain, GoFood assigns this order to one outlet.\nHowever, the driver partner may decide to visit another outlet and pick up the\norder, as per convenience.\n\nThere were more problems galore.\n\nIf a merchant partner was not open for business on a particular day, and wanted\nto update their menu, or indicate items as out of stock, they had to call the\nGojek Customer Care. During this time, orders would still be coming in, which\nresulted in driver partners accepting orders that most certainly couldn‚Äôt be\ncompleted without a hassle.\n\nThere was a lot that needed fixing here, and it could only be done by\nintegrating merchants more deeply into our ecosystem. So, that‚Äôs exactly what we\ndid.\n\nPhase 3: The merchant app, GoResto\nTowards the end of 2016, a concept was developed for an app that would cater to\nmerchant partners, and by early 2017 GoResto (which is what we called it at the\ntime) was ready.\n\nWe introduced the following in GoResto:\n\n1. Electronic payments\nAll of Gojek‚Äôs driver partners had GoPay e-wallets associated with their\naccounts. With GoResto, we did the same for our GoFood partners. Transactions\nbetween driver and GoFood partners was directly wallet-to-wallet, hence,\ncashless.\n\n2. PIN exchange for restaurant verification\nTo ensure the order is secured, driver partners would also need to share a PIN\nwith the merchant while picking up the order. This electronic handshake helped\nus verify they were indeed picking up the right order from the right outlet.\n\n3. Catalog management\nWe noticed a lot of cancellations were happening because the items were either\nout of stock, restaurants were closed or customers were generally skeptical\nabout ordering dishes that didn‚Äôt have enough reference images. So, we started\nfocussing more on improving the product experience for our customers and BCR\n(booking completion rate). Catalog management was introduced so that the\nmerchants could regularly update details that customers saw on GoFood. For\nexample: Availability status of dishes that were put on the menu, uploading\ndetails pertaining to different items sold, etc.\n\nIn the meanwhile, GoResto was rebranded to GoBiz. What started off as a product\nthat helped merchants to manage their food orders, started evolving into\nsomething bigger. Since the scope extended beyond GoFood, calling it ‚ÄòGoResto‚Äô\nmade no sense.\n\nThe rebranding came with enhanced features in GoBiz. As you might‚Äôve guessed, it\nalso came with new, enhanced problems and a sub-optimal flow:\n\n‚ö†Ô∏è The driver partner was ready, but the food wasn‚Äôt\n> The average time taken for a driver partner was:\n~9 minutes to pick up an order\n~19 minutes to deliver the order\nA portion of this time was spent by the driver waiting for the food to be\nprepared, because in most cases, GoFood partners started preparing food only\nafter the driver arrived! This was mostly because customer would add more food\nitems or the ordered items would be out of stock. We figured that the driver\narrival time could be parallelised with the food prep time. This led to 2\nimportant things:\n\n * Overall delivery time for the customer could be reduced\n * Wait time for the driver could be utilised to fulfil other orders\n\nÔ∏èÔ∏èÔ∏è‚ö†Ô∏è GoFood Partner-driven cancellations existed, accountability didn‚Äôt\nGoFood partners had the ability to set their open hours and change item\navailability, but they didn‚Äôt always keep it updated. When cancellations\npertaining to these reasons happened, they were handled by‚Ä¶the driver partners.\nü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è\nThis meant, the orders had to be cancelled either by the driver partners or the\ncustomers themselves.\n\n> Items being out of stock or restaurants being closed accounted for over 35% of\nall customer cancellations after a driver was assigned.\nOn the driver side, these accounted for over 75% of all driver cancellations. üòì\n‚ö†Ô∏è Price edits became pricey\nIn this order flow, the driver placed the final order with the merchant. This\nessentially means that the original order placed by the customer could be\nmodified due to various reasons: Incorrect listing of price, unavailability of\nitems, adding new items to the order, etc. To accommodate these cases, drivers\nwere allowed to input to final price of the order, leading to a price edit.\n\nAnd price edits aren‚Äôt uncommon. They happen to ~34% of the orders.\n\nMultiple moving pieces exposed these orders to skip payments or consumer wallet\nsweeps.\n\nPhase 4: Introducing Merchant Acceptance Flow\nDue to various reasons, our driver partners were handling GoFood partner-driven\ncancellations and heavy-lifting to ensure the orders were fulfilled. This, too,\nhad to change.\n\nAfter brainstorming, mind-mapping and head-scratching, we arrived at Merchant\nAccept Flow (MAF). The merchants who are onboarded to MAF are called Super\nPartners. The solution lets our Super Partners accept/reject orders based on the\nrestaurant being open, availability of items, or any other factors that\ndetermine order fulfilment or cancellation. This in turn helps our customers and\ndriver partners know that the merchant is preparing food for sure, so that there\nare no customer or driver cancellations.\n\nIn Part-2 of this blog, we‚Äôll dive deep into Merchant Acceptance Flow, how we\nwent about designing it and introducing Super Partners to our customers.

It was far from ideal because there was no record of transactions besides a booking on GoFood and a receipt handed to the driver partner.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://gojek-ghost.zysk.in/content/images/2020/06/image-17.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>Often there were discrepancies in the number of orders assigned and the number of orders completed. How, you ask?</p><p>Imagine a GoFood partner who is part of a large chain of restaurants. When someone orders food from this chain, GoFood assigns this order to one outlet. However, the driver partner may decide to visit another outlet and pick up the order, as per convenience.</p><h3 id=\"there-were-more-problems-galore-\"><em>There were more problems galore.</em><br></h3><p>If a merchant partner was not open for business on a particular day, and wanted to update their menu, or indicate items as out of stock, they had to call the Gojek Customer Care. During this time, orders would still be coming in, which resulted in driver partners accepting orders that most certainly couldn‚Äôt be completed without a hassle.</p><p>There was a lot that needed fixing here, and it could only be done by integrating merchants more deeply into our ecosystem. So, that‚Äôs exactly what we did.</p><h3 id=\"phase-3-the-merchant-app-goresto\">Phase 3: The merchant app, GoResto</h3><p>Towards the end of 2016, a concept was developed for an app that would cater to merchant partners, and by early 2017 GoResto (which is what we called it at the time) was ready.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://gojek-ghost.zysk.in/content/images/2020/06/image-18.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>We introduced the following in GoResto:</p><h4 id=\"1-electronic-payments\">1. Electronic payments</h4><p>All of Gojek‚Äôs driver partners had GoPay e-wallets associated with their accounts. With GoResto, we did the same for our GoFood partners. Transactions between driver and GoFood partners was directly wallet-to-wallet, hence, cashless.</p><h4 id=\"2-pin-exchange-for-restaurant-verification\">2. PIN exchange for restaurant verification</h4><p>To ensure the order is secured, driver partners would also need to share a PIN with the merchant while picking up the order. This electronic handshake helped us verify they were indeed picking up the right order from the right outlet.</p><h4 id=\"3-catalog-management\">3. Catalog management</h4><p>We noticed a lot of cancellations were happening because the items were either out of stock, restaurants were closed or customers were generally skeptical about ordering dishes that didn‚Äôt have enough reference images. So, we started focussing more on improving the product experience for our customers and BCR (booking completion rate). Catalog management was introduced so that the merchants could regularly update details that customers saw on GoFood. For example: Availability status of dishes that were put on the menu, uploading details pertaining to different items sold, etc.</p><p>In the meanwhile, GoResto was rebranded to GoBiz. What started off as a product that helped merchants to manage their food orders, started evolving into something bigger. Since the scope extended beyond GoFood, calling it ‚ÄòGoResto‚Äô made no sense.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*UTfTFeb5u4dc8PbMRnyYtA.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>The rebranding came with enhanced features in GoBiz. As you might‚Äôve guessed, it also came with new, enhanced problems and a sub-optimal flow:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*7ZHFNcogEuyAGZ86zomAuw.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><h4 id=\"-the-driver-partner-was-ready-but-the-food-wasn-t\">‚ö†Ô∏è The driver partner was ready, but the food wasn‚Äôt</h4><blockquote>The average time taken for a driver partner was:<br>~9 minutes to pick up an order<br>~19 minutes to deliver the order</blockquote><p>A portion of this time was spent by the driver waiting for the food to be prepared, because in most cases, GoFood partners started preparing food only after the driver arrived! This was mostly because customer would add more food items or the ordered items would be out of stock. We figured that the driver arrival time could be parallelised with the food prep time. This led to 2 important things:</p><ul><li>Overall delivery time for the customer could be reduced</li><li>Wait time for the driver could be utilised to fulfil other orders</li></ul><h4 id=\"-gofood-partner-driven-cancellations-existed-accountability-didn-t\">Ô∏èÔ∏èÔ∏è‚ö†Ô∏è GoFood Partner-driven cancellations existed, accountability didn‚Äôt</h4><p>GoFood partners had the ability to set their open hours and change item availability, but they didn‚Äôt always keep it updated. When cancellations pertaining to these reasons happened, they were handled by‚Ä¶the driver partners. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è<br>This meant, the orders had to be cancelled either by the driver partners or the customers themselves.</p><blockquote>Items being out of stock or restaurants being closed accounted for over 35% of all customer cancellations after a driver was assigned.<br>On the driver side, these accounted for over 75% of all driver cancellations. üòì</blockquote><h4 id=\"-price-edits-became-pricey\">‚ö†Ô∏è Price edits became pricey</h4><p>In this order flow, the driver placed the final order with the merchant. This essentially means that the original order placed by the customer could be modified due to various reasons: Incorrect listing of price, unavailability of items, adding new items to the order, etc. To accommodate these cases, drivers were allowed to input to final price of the order, leading to a price edit.</p><h3 id=\"and-price-edits-aren-t-uncommon-they-happen-to-34-of-the-orders-\"><em>And price edits aren‚Äôt uncommon. They happen to ~34% of the orders.</em></h3><p><br>Multiple moving pieces exposed these orders to skip payments or consumer wallet sweeps.</p><h3 id=\"phase-4-introducing-merchant-acceptance-flow\">Phase 4: Introducing Merchant Acceptance Flow</h3><p>Due to various reasons, our driver partners were handling GoFood partner-driven cancellations and heavy-lifting to ensure the orders were fulfilled. This, too, had to change.</p><p>After brainstorming, mind-mapping and head-scratching, we arrived at Merchant Accept Flow (MAF). The merchants who are onboarded to MAF are called Super Partners. The solution lets our Super Partners accept/reject orders based on the restaurant being open, availability of items, or any other factors that determine order fulfilment or cancellation. This in turn helps our customers and driver partners know that the merchant is preparing food for sure, so that there are no customer or driver cancellations.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*5FbUDwJLqdnyjJIPwbaOYQ.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>In Part-2 of this blog, we‚Äôll dive deep into Merchant Acceptance Flow, how we went about designing it and introducing Super Partners to our customers.

How do such diverse people come together and build\namazing things? That‚Äôs where Program Management comes into the picture.\n\nThe Challenge\nGoMerchants PDG was formed from five separate teams (SPOTS, Midtrans, Mapan,\nGoResto, Nadipos), and each team had a unique engineering culture. Across teams,\nthe total number of staff involved in cross-functional work was ~240 people.\n\nAfter a discovery phase of the process over 3 months with the various groups, we\nfound that every team was utilising different versions of project management\nmethodology and tools to track team progress. Across various teams, we\nidentified nearly a dozen different types of tools and methods including the\nScrum method, Kanban method, Jira tools, Favro Tools, and Trello tools.\n\nThe key takeaway was clear: There was no single source of truth for tracking\nteam deployment progress.\n\nThe Solution\nTo achieve our goal of reaching a high rate of (quality) deliverables with clear\ntransparency on progress, the Program Managers decided to build a program that\nset a single standard workflow for everyone involved. The end result? A meld of\nAgile best practices and a limited/select set of tools.\n\nAt the highest level, Program Management methodology focuses on adding just \nenough processes to help with efficiency ‚Äî and not creating convoluted processes\nfor the sake of process. Keeping these best practices in mind, the workflow\nbuilt by the GoMerchants Program Management team entailed Scrum Process to track\nbacklog priority, using Confluence as a documentation hub, Jira for managing\nbacklog tasks, Pre-Iteration Planning Meetings, Sprint Planning, Daily Standups,\nand lastly, conducting regular Retrospectives.\n\nThe consolidated approach helped the GoMerchants team reach the rapid pace\nneeded to hit targeting of deliverables‚Äî but also helped support the team in an\nenvironment of rapidly-changing requirements via greater transparency.\n\nThere were additional benefits to this approach, as well: Instantaneous feedback\nfrom the team on what was working (and what was not), metrics to inform future\niterations of the workflow, and a reduction in deployment failure ‚Äî and rollback\ndeployment risk ‚Äî thanks to rapid and continuous internal communication.\n\n> ‚ÄúAgile software development is an approach to software development under which\nrequirements and solutions evolve through the collaborative effort of\nself-organizing and cross-functional teams and their customer(s)/end user(s).‚Äù ‚Äî\nCollier, Ken W. (2011). Agile Analytics: A Value-Driven Approach to Business\nIntelligence and Data Warehousing. Pearson Education.\nTo transform quality deployment with high pace targets, the program implemented\nfar better collaboration for a large team than previously existed.\n\nAt the same time, Jira was chosen as the one crucial tool for backlog management\nfor GoMerchants. The factors in selecting Jira were the platform functionality\nis highly-configurable to the specific requirements of a team, as well, as it\nhas the flexibility to allow for usage in a wide variety of environments and\nprocesses.\n\nScrum Activities\nBelow is the flow of scrum activity. It starts from Pre-Iteration Planning\nMeeting (Pre-IPM), Retrospective, IPM/Sprint Planning, and Daily Standup:\n\nSprints\nA Sprint is a time-box of iterations, where the releasable works that align with\nsprint goals are implemented. A Sprint always has a fixed start and end date ‚Äî\nthese dates should be of the same duration; typically two weeks.\n\nSource: Essential Scrum: A Practical Guide to the Most Popular Agile Process\nSprints notes: While most of GoMerchants PDG uses two-week sprints, the length\nof time can depend on several factors like the final deadline, number of people\nin the team, and holidays in the calendar. Some teams use a one-week Sprint\ncycle due to urgent work that requires moving at an accelerated pace. But,\ngenerally it is not a best practice to use one-week sprint cycles as team\nachievement moments can be missed, quality could be sacrificed, and team\nburn-out is a real risk.\n\nPre-I.P.M. (Pre-Iteration Planning Meeting)\nPre-IPM is an activity to review the active Sprint and manage backlog and Sprint\ngoal(s) for the next iteration. Pre-IPM is attended by a Product Manager, Tech\nLeads, and Program Manager. The Product Manager should write-up the ‚Äòstory‚Äô aka\nplan, in Jira after Pre-IPM. Tech lead should advise if the story and goals for\nthe next iteration are technically achievable.\n\nAs a Program Manager, you can use spreadsheets for mapping between the story and\nteam before doing the IPM. Below is the example:\n\nPre-IPM notes: This is basically a small meeting with a PM, TechLead, HoE/HoP\n(if necessary) and PgM. The purpose is to finalise the work backlog for the team\nin the upcoming Sprint. This meeting will help streamline the Sprint Planning\nmeeting by confirming that the final requirements have been aligned by all\nstakeholders ‚Äî the goal being to reduce the number of ‚ÄúRequirement Changes‚Äù\ngoing forward. .\n\nRetrospective\nThe purpose of a retrospective in IPM is to collect previous sprint feedback\nfrom the team. It contains some columns like:\n\n * Glad: What makes you happy in this sprint or things that went well\n * Sad: What makes you sad in this sprint and from here we can see how we can\n   improve it\n * Mad: What makes you mad or frustrated in this sprint\n * Ideas: Idea to improve our next sprint\n * Appreciation: Appreciation in this sprint, esp if there‚Äôs a pretty big team\n   achievement\n * Action Item: Action item to improve our next sprint based on Sad, Mad, and\n   Ideas columns. This is the important part to be followed up so ‚Äúlesson\n   learned‚Äù value from every sprint is really working\n\nWe can use several tools to help us collect data, i.e. https://funretro.io/,\nbelow is the example:\n\nSend a retrospective link to a Slack channel before IPM and encourage the team\nto fill the cards. Do the retrospective by talking through each column 15‚Äì30\nminutes before IPM starts.\n\nRetrospective notes: This session provides the opportunity for a team to look\nback and see how they can improve. Retrospectives can be a catalyst for\norganisational change, team change or even a culture change. The Retrospective\ncan be a place to build and enable teams, or to help teams start their journey\nwith a clear understanding of where to go next. It‚Äôs a method that is very\nuseful to gauge the Team Happiness state and gain Improvement Feedback from the\nteam. A Retrospective also builds trust and helps make the team grow stronger as\nindividual members know they have an outlet to express their feedback and they\nwill be heard by their managers and colleagues.

To achieve this, multiple Product Development Groups (PDG) exist within Gojek. One of these is the GoMerchants PDG, that handles all our merchant-centric initiatives, including GoBiz, our SuperApp for merchant partners.</p><p>GoMerchants is an entity formed by the fusion of multiple teams that all had their own work styles. How do such diverse people come together and build amazing things? That‚Äôs where Program Management comes into the picture.</p><h3 id=\"the-challenge\">The Challenge</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*BOZMTMudwppvAHi6\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>GoMerchants PDG was formed from five separate teams (SPOTS, Midtrans, Mapan, GoResto, Nadipos), and each team had a unique engineering culture. Across teams, the total number of staff involved in cross-functional work was ~240 people.</p><p>After a discovery phase of the process over 3 months with the various groups, we found that every team was utilising different versions of project management methodology and tools to track team progress. Across various teams, we identified nearly a dozen different types of tools and methods including the Scrum method, Kanban method, Jira tools, Favro Tools, and Trello tools.</p><p>The key takeaway was clear: There was no single source of truth for tracking team deployment progress.</p><h3 id=\"the-solution\">The Solution</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*xz0BID0wK762a3It\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>To achieve our goal of reaching a high rate of (quality) deliverables with clear transparency on progress, the Program Managers decided to build a program that set a single standard workflow for everyone involved. The end result? A meld of Agile best practices and a limited/select set of tools.</p><p>At the highest level, Program Management methodology focuses on adding just<em><em> </em></em>enough processes to help with efficiency ‚Äî and not creating convoluted processes for the sake of process. Keeping these best practices in mind, the workflow built by the GoMerchants Program Management team entailed Scrum Process to track backlog priority, using Confluence as a documentation hub, Jira for managing backlog tasks, Pre-Iteration Planning Meetings, Sprint Planning, Daily Standups, and lastly, conducting regular Retrospectives.</p><p>The consolidated approach helped the GoMerchants team reach the rapid pace needed to hit targeting of deliverables‚Äî but also helped support the team in an environment of rapidly-changing requirements via greater transparency.</p><p>There were additional benefits to this approach, as well: Instantaneous feedback from the team on what was working (and what was not), metrics to inform future iterations of the workflow, and a reduction in deployment failure ‚Äî and rollback deployment risk ‚Äî thanks to rapid and continuous internal communication.</p><blockquote><em><em>‚ÄúAgile software development is an approach to software development under which requirements and solutions evolve through the collaborative effort of self-organizing and cross-functional teams and their customer(s)/end user(s).‚Äù ‚Äî Collier, Ken W.

Pearson Education.</em></em></blockquote><p>To transform quality deployment with high pace targets, the program implemented far better collaboration for a large team than previously existed.</p><p>At the same time, Jira was chosen as the one crucial tool for backlog management for GoMerchants. The factors in selecting Jira were the platform functionality is highly-configurable to the specific requirements of a team, as well, as it has the flexibility to allow for usage in a wide variety of environments and processes.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*6BKaz05opZRwL9_K\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><h3 id=\"scrum-activities\">Scrum Activities</h3><p>Below is the flow of scrum activity.

Voila!! You got a driver. That was\nfast. You can see your driver‚Äôs location on the map, and the estimated time they\nwould take to come to you.\n\nBut hang on‚Ä¶ It seems like the map is a bit messed up.\n\nThe driver location on the map goes back and forth at unreal speed, and even\nflies over buildings. Starring in an action movie is not exactly how you want to\nstart your week. üòÆ\n\nWhile our driver-partners sure are superman in their own unique way, they\ncertainly can‚Äôt drive over buildings. This is clearly not how your driver is\nactually driving on the road. But then why is the map showing all this?\n\nWell, there are multiple factors that can lead to a bad experience like that.\nSome within our control, some not so much (as of now). We decided to go back to\nthe drawing board and figure out the issues that are in our control and fix them\nfor good. And that is how we built a world-class (arguably üò¨) live-tracking\nexperience.\n\nBut what is live-tracking, you would ask?\n\nLive tracking is a complete map experience. It doesn‚Äôt involve anything other\nthan what you see on maps after you get a driver.\n\nSo, what do you see on maps?\n\n 1. Driver's location depicted by a green marker.\n 2. The routes.\n 3. The change in driver marker as the driver moves closer to your pickup/your\n    destination.\n 4. The change in route as the driver moves.\n\nAnd that‚Äôs it. That‚Äôs all live-tracking is.\n\n> But that sounds quite simple. Right? Use some routing APIs and plot the markers\nand routes.\nWell, yes, it sounded easy to us when we first heard about it too. The real\nexperience threw us a few curveballs. Let‚Äôs go through how we create a\nlive-tracking experience.\n\nInput\nLet‚Äôs look at the input data that we need to create a live-tracking animation:\n\nDriver Location and Routes\nOur driver apps have an in-built mechanism to upload driver location to our\nbackend at regular intervals. This is how we are able to find a driver close to\nyour location when you order one of our services. The primary input to\nlive-tracking is this driver location.\n\nIn our driver app, we get this location using Android‚Äôs FusedLocationProvider \nAPI which automatically uses the best location provider(GPS, Wifi, etc). The\ndriver location is ingested into our backend system via a continuous stream.\nRoutes are generated by our internal routing engine and provided to the customer\napp.\n\nInput Source\nAs you would have guessed, this data is provided via API calls initiated by the\nour Super App to the routing engine.\n\nMaking the API call just once won‚Äôt be sufficient. Right? The app needs to be\ninformed every time the driver‚Äôs location has changed. So, the customer app\npolls this API every few seconds to get this data.\n\nNow, we have a continuous stream of data flowing to our app which has all the\ninformation that we need to show the vehicle animation on the road.\n\nTerminology\nBefore moving forward, we should get acquainted with a few terminologies that we\nwould use quite frequently in this post.\n\n 1. Route: The entire list of latitude-longitudes between the driver location to\n    the pickup/destination location.\n 2. Segment: A segment is the smallest unit of a route. It is a straight line\n    from one position in the routes list to the very next position in the routes\n    list.\n\nA route of length n has n-1 segments. Confused? Yeah, let‚Äôs take an example.\n\nA Route looks like this:\n\n[{-62441198, 106.8032959},\n{-6.2440766, 106.80328}, \n{-6.2439977, 106.8033275},\n{-6.2434893, 106.8029214},\n{-6.2433926, 106.8030539},\n{-6.2436018, 106.803222}]\n\nThere are 5 Segments in this route.\n\nSegment 1: {-6.2441198, 106.8032959,-6.2440766, 106.80328}\nSegment 2: {-6.2440766, 106.80328,-6.2439977, 106.8033275}\nSegment 3: {-6.2439977, 106.8033275,-6.2434893, 106.8029214}\nSegment 4: {-6.2434893, 106.8029214,-6.2433926, 106.8030539}\nSegment 5: {-6.2433926, 106.8030539,-6.2436018, 106.8032224}\n\nThe initial setup\nWhen the user lands on the live tracking screen, the app immediately makes a\ncall to our internal API to get the driver location and route. Once we get this\ndata, we plot it on the map using the standard GoogleMap methods. \ngoogleMap.addMarker(), googleMap.addPolyline() etc.\n\nSometimes, we don‚Äôt have the routing information available immediately, so we\njust show the driver marker. We also store this data locally in an in-memory\ncache as we would need it later to do some comparisons.\n\nSo, the customer is able to see the markers and routes on the map now. So far so\ngood.\n\nThe subsequent updates\nAs I mentioned earlier, we need to change the position of driver marker and\nroute as the driver moves. The customer app makes a call to the same internal\nAPI every few seconds. After the first response, we don‚Äôt move any markers or\nroutes on the map until the next response succeeds.\n\nIn the next response, we again get the same data points i.e the route and driver\nlocation but with different values, of course, if the driver has moved. The next\nset of data that we get can have the following characteristics:\n\n 1. Route and driver location don‚Äôt change\n 2. Route changes\n 3. Route doesn‚Äôt change BUT driver location does\n\nLet‚Äôs discuss these cases one by one.\n\n1: Route and driver location don‚Äôt change\nIf nothing has changed, we don‚Äôt need to do anything. Probably our driver\npartner is stuck in traffic. üòû\n\n2: Route changes\nThis can happen either when:\n\n 1. The app was not showing any route to the user before i.e the first response\n    didn‚Äôt have the route.\n 2. The app was showing a route that is different from the newly received route.\n    This usually happens in cases where the driver starts following a different\n    route from the one they were following before. This can also happen due to\n    road closures or simply because our driver-partner initially followed a\n    wrong route by mistake üòÖ.\n\nIn either of these cases, we simply ignore the old driver marker and routes\nwhich were shown and plot the new marker and routes.\n\n3: Route doesn‚Äôt change BUT driver location does\nThe app was showing the same route to the user before i.e the old response had\nthe same route as the new response. This means that the driver is following the\noriginal route that we determined.\n\nIn this case, we need to animate the driver marker on the map from the old\nlocation to the new location along the same route. This is the most common\nscenario, which can again be broken down further into multiple scenarios (yeah,\nI‚Äôm all about breaking things down ü§ê).\n\n3.1: Does the new location lie on the route?\nTo animate the driver marker from it‚Äôs current position to the new location, we\nfirst need to know whether the new location lies on the route or not.\n\nYeah, we can‚Äôt be sure that the driver location that we have received would\nalways lie on the route/road because of various GPS inaccuracy issues.\n\nWe iterate through every segment in the route to find the segment which has the\nnew location. For every segment, we use the Geometry/PolyUtil library to\ndetermine whether the driver location lies on that route.\n\nWe also specify a tolerance of a few meters to account for GPS inaccuracy. So,\nif the newly received location is within a radius of X meters near a segment,\nthis method will return true.\n\nAndroid\n\nboolean isLocationOnPath(LatLng point,List<LatLng> polyline,boolean geodesic,\ndouble tolerance)\n\niOS\n\nBOOL GMSGeometryIsLocationOnPathToleranc\n[https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios-sdk/reference/group___geometry_utils#ga580ba381b9d4fbc0ff430cf69e06e66d]\ne(CLLocationCoordinate2D point,GMSPath\n[https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios-sdk/reference/interface_g_m_s_path] \n* path,BOOL geodesic,CLLocationDistance tolerance)\n\nIf the location doesn‚Äôt lie on any of the segments in the route, we are sad and\nso, we don‚Äôt animate anything. But if it does, we go forward with the next step\nwhich is‚Ä¶.\n\n3.2: Vehicle projection on route\nWhen we receive a new location, the start location is simply the position that\nthe driver marker is already at. No logic required there to calculate that.\n\nThe end location should simply be the new location that we received. Well, in an\nideal world, it should be but we live so far away from an ideal world üòû.\n\nAs we mentioned earlier, the raw driver location that we get from the driver app\nvia GPS/other providers mostly doesn‚Äôt lie on the road. So, we have to find a\nprojection of the driver location on the road/route.\n\nIf you have been reading carefully, you might wonder why we can‚Äôt just use the \nisLocationOnPath() method above ü§î.\n\nWell, if you had been reading more carefully, you might have noticed that this\nmethod returns a boolean explaining whether the location is on/near the route or\nnot ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇ. It doesn‚Äôt return the projected location. (Ohh..if someone from Maps\nUtils stumbled upon this by chance, please add that method, good sir).\n\nSo, we had to revise some maths. Yeah, folks, learn your maths well. You never\nknow when a situation like this might arise ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ.\n\n‚ÄúFind the projection of point (x,y) on the line y = mx + c‚Äù. Does that ring a\nbell? Drawing a perpendicular line towards the segment and calculating the\nlocation of where the line and route intersect can give us the projected\nlocation. Right?\n\nWell, the above approach works for 2-D systems but earth is not a 2-D space. We\nneed a way to project the spherical surface of the earth onto a rectangle 2-D\nspace. There are several ways to do that. All of them have certain drawbacks. We\nmight lose information like direction or the shape of landmasses/countries or\nthe area information.\n\nMercator Projection\n\nMercator projection is one of the available methods to project the spherical map\nof earth onto a rectangle to make usable maps. Most of the mapping tools used\nfor navigation use this projection.\n\nThe key feature of Mercator projection is that it retains the direction\ninformation. That means if point A is 30deg east from north of point B on the\nglobe, it will be in the same direction on its Mercator projection. Or say there\nis a turn of 90deg in some lane, it will be 90deg on Mercator projection as\nwell. That is the reason it works really well for navigation purposes.\n\nHow to use a Mercator projection?\n\n 1. Every point on the earth is projected on a cylinder exactly like point A\n    which has point A‚Äô on the cylinder.\n 2. Once all the required points/routes are projected on this cylinder. It is\n    unrolled, and we obtain a rectangle like the one shown above.\n 3. All the planar geometry can be applied with a very little margin of error on\n    this 2D projected map.\n 4. After processing all the points/routes they can be converted back to\n    latitude and longitude on the globe.\n\nSo, now we have the projected driver location on the route which we will fondly\ncall snapped point going forward.\n\n3.3: End-to-End animation\nThe new driver location that we receive can be present in any segment. It may be\nthat it is in the same segment or it may be that it is on the next segment or on\nthe next one or it may be that it is on the last segment.\n\nBut for linear animation, we need a start point and an end point. The start\npoint is the current position of the driver marker. We already got the snapped\nendpoint in the earlier section. But we can‚Äôt just animate from start to end at\nonce as that would seem like the car is flying and ignoring U-turns, routes,\netc. So, how do we prevent it from flying?\n\nWhat do you do when you can‚Äôt fly to a place? You follow the road. Right? That‚Äôs\nwhat we have to do as well. Make the driver marker follow the route/road. We\nneed to animate along each segment in the route until we reach the segment which\nhas the driver position that we received.\n\nThere are again two cases here üòú:\n\n3.3.1: The new driver location is on the same segment\nIn this case, we can directly animate from the current position of driver marker\nto the driver location that we received since this is just a straight line\nanimation.\n\nA segment is always a straight line. We will discuss more on how to do the\nanimation b/w 2 points in a later section.\n\n3.3.2: The new driver location is on a different segment\nIn this case, we need to animate to that segment along the route. We have to\nanimate along each of the segments in between to reach the final segment.\n\nFor animation along the first segment, we set the endpoint of the animation to\nthe beginning of the next segment in the route. We animate to the end of the\nfirst segment.\n\nThe next segment may also not have the driver location that we received. After a\ndriver has traversed the first segment, we move the end location of the\nanimation to the end of the next segment, and so on and so forth till we reach\nthe last segment. Confusing, ya? Let‚Äôs see an example.\n\nSo much zig-zag (huh!!)The car icon(A) represents the location in the segment\nwhere the driver marker currently is. The red pin(X) represents the new snapped\nlocation received.\n\nIn the 1st animation, we move the driver marker from A to the end of the first\nsegment (B).\n\nIn the 2nd animation, the driver marker is moved through the entire length of\nthe 2nd segment.\n\nAnd so on and so forth till we reach the segment which has the newly received\nsnapped location (X).\n\nAnimation in a segment\nWe now know how the overall animation would look like. But we also need to\nconfigure how the smallest unit of the animation i.e animation in a segment\nshould happen.\n\nStart point and End point: For case #1 above, the animation in a segment will\nhappen just once. For case #2 above, this animation in a segment will happen\nmultiple times. Start and endpoints will be determined before beginning each of\nthe animations.\n\nBearing b/w these two points: Bearing can be calculated using another one of\nGeometry/Maps Utils method.\n\nSphericalUtil.computeHeading(startPosition, endPosition)\n\nDuration of animation: Calculating duration is a bit tricky. And the duration is\nthe most important thing in any animation. Sometimes the difference b/w a smooth\nand a choppy animation is caused by the duration. It was very important that we\ngot it right. So, let‚Äôs take a break and see how to calculate the duration.\n\nWhat is Duration?\nIt‚Äôs the amount of time for which the animation should happen. But you already\nknow that. Going back to middle school maths (yeah, that far), how do you\ncalculate time? Time is nothing but distance divided by speed. Correct?\nCalculating straight line distance b/w the two points we want to animate through\nis pretty easy.\n\nSphericalUtil.computeDistanceBetween(startLocation, endLocation)\n\nCool, cool. But what about speed? How should we calculate speed?\n\nSpeed calculation\nFusedLocationProvider API in the driver app does provide the speed of the\nvehicle but it‚Äôs highly unreliable. So, we have to employ some tricks to\ncalculate the speed.\n\nSpeed is distance divided by time. Distance again!! Seems like we are running in\ncircles üòµ. Not exactly. Here the distance is not the straight line distance b/w\nthe two points that we have to animate through.\n\nThis is the total distance along the route from the segment that the old driver\nlocation is currently located at, to the segment where the new driver location\nis. Yeah, that statement is a bit confusing. So, let‚Äôs take an example.\n\nThe car icon(A) represents the location in the segment where the driver marker\ncurrently is. The red pin(X) represents the new snapped location received. To\ncalculate the distance, we do the obvious:\n\nTotal distance = d1 + d2 + d3 + d4\n\nNow, we have the distance. We need the time interval.\n\nThe FusedLocationProvider API in the driver app does provide us the timestamp at\nwhich a location was updated. And this information is passed to our backend and\nsubsequently to the customer app.\n\nWe calculate the time difference b/w the old driver location and the new driver\nlocation using their timestamps. Wait, how do we know the old driver location?\nAs we had mentioned earlier, we cache the last available driver location and\nroute in an in-memory cache.\n\nTotal route distance divided by time and now we have the speed for the entire\nduration. Linear distance divided by this speed and now we have the durationfor\na single animation in a segment. Cool, so let‚Äôs get back to the point where we\nbroke off üòÖ.\n\nUpdate the animation\nWith all the above information, we start the animation. But wait? Aren‚Äôt we\nmissing something? We did start an animation b/w two points but how will our\nanimator know how to animate?\n\nAnimation is just a bunch of frame updates that happen every fast. How do we\nupdate the marker position, the starting point of the route, the rotation in\neach and every frame of the animation? Well, the mobile/web framework allows us\nto do something every time the frame is updated.\n\nBut what is this something that we should do?\n\n1. Update marker‚Äôs position\nFor markers, we need to update their position. Once we have the position, we can\nsimply update the marker position using the marker.setPosition(). To find the\nposition during each frame of the animation, we need the percentage of animation\nthat has elapsed.\n\nWe can get the percentage from the Animation framework. Using this percentage\nand the start and end position, we calculate the intermediate position/s like\nthis:\n\nSphericalUtil.interpolate(startPosition, endPosition, fraction)\n\n2. Update Routes\nRoutes need to be aligned with the marker‚Äôs movement. So, we update the routes\nas well using the values above and updating the polyline points of that route\nusing the polyline.setPoints().\n\nAnd that‚Äôs a wrap. The result that we get is a very smooth, measured movement of\nthe vehicle along the road.\n\nThere are a few more tips/tricks that we employ to ensure that there are no\nabrupt changes in the animation.\n\nBut that‚Äôs for next time. üòÉ\n\nWhat‚Äôs next?\nWe still need to go a long way to meet the standards that we have set for\nourselves. Currently, this new experience is only rolled out to GoRide, GoCar,\nand GoBluebird. We are working on bringing the same experience to other services\nlike GoFood, GoSend, and GoShop.

Voila!! You got a driver. That was fast. You can see your driver‚Äôs location on the map, and the estimated time they would take to come to you.</p><p><em><em>But hang on‚Ä¶ It seems like the map is a bit messed up.</em></em></p><p>The driver location on the map goes back and forth at unreal speed, and even flies over buildings. Starring in an action movie is not exactly how you want to start your week. üòÆ</p><p>While our driver-partners sure are superman in their own unique way, they certainly can‚Äôt drive over buildings. This is clearly not how your driver is actually driving on the road. But then why is the map showing all this?</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://gojek-ghost.zysk.in/content/images/2020/05/LiveTracking2.gif\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>Well, there are multiple factors that can lead to a bad experience like that. Some within our control, some not so much (as of now). We decided to go back to the drawing board and figure out the issues that are in our control and fix them for good. And that is how we built a world-class (arguably üò¨) live-tracking experience.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://gojek-ghost.zysk.in/content/images/2020/05/image.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>But what is live-tracking, you would ask?</p><p>Live tracking is a complete map experience. It doesn‚Äôt involve anything other than what you see on maps after you get a driver.</p><p>So, what do you see on maps?</p><ol><li>Driver's location depicted by a green marker.</li><li>The routes.</li><li>The change in driver marker as the driver moves closer to your pickup/your destination.</li><li>The change in route as the driver moves.</li></ol><p>And that‚Äôs it. That‚Äôs all live-tracking is.</p><blockquote><em><em>But that sounds quite simple. Right? Use some routing APIs and plot the markers and routes.</em></em></blockquote><p>Well, yes, it sounded easy to us when we first heard about it too. The real experience threw us a few curveballs. Let‚Äôs go through how we create a live-tracking experience.</p><h3 id=\"input\">Input</h3><p>Let‚Äôs look at the input data that we need to create a live-tracking animation:</p><h3 id=\"driver-location-and-routes\">Driver Location and Routes</h3><p>Our driver apps have an in-built mechanism to upload driver location to our backend at regular intervals. This is how we are able to find a driver close to your location when you order one of our services. The primary input to live-tracking is this driver location.</p><p>In our driver app, we get this location using Android‚Äôs <code>FusedLocationProvider</code> API which automatically uses the best location provider(GPS, Wifi, etc). The driver location is ingested into our backend system via a continuous stream. Routes are generated by our internal routing engine and provided to the customer app.</p><h3 id=\"input-source\">Input Source</h3><p>As you would have guessed, this data is provided via API calls initiated by the our Super App to the routing engine.</p><p>Making the API call just once won‚Äôt be sufficient. Right? The app needs to be informed every time the driver‚Äôs location has changed. So, the customer app polls this API every few seconds to get this data.</p><p>Now, we have a continuous stream of data flowing to our app which has all the information that we need to show the vehicle animation on the road.</p><h3 id=\"terminology\">Terminology</h3><p>Before moving forward, we should get acquainted with a few terminologies that we would use quite frequently in this post.</p><ol><li><strong><strong>Route</strong></strong>: The entire list of latitude-longitudes between the driver location to the pickup/destination location.</li><li><strong><strong>Segment</strong></strong>: A segment is the smallest unit of a route. It is a straight line from one position in the routes list to the very next position in the routes list.</li></ol><p>A route of length n has n-1 segments. Confused? Yeah, let‚Äôs take an example.</p><p>A <strong><strong>Route</strong></strong> looks like this:</p><p>[{-6<code>2441198, 106.8032959},<br>{-6.2440766, 106.80328}, <br>{-6.2439977, 106.8033275},<br>{-6.2434893, 106.8029214},<br>{-6.2433926, 106.8030539},<br>{-6.2436018, 106.803222}]</code></p><p>There are 5 <strong><strong>Segments</strong></strong> in this route.</p><p><code>Segment 1: {-6.2441198, 106.8032959,-6.2440766, 106.80328}</code><br><code>Segment 2: {-6.2440766, 106.80328,-6.2439977, 106.8033275}</code><br><code>Segment 3: {-6.2439977, 106.8033275,-6.2434893, 106.8029214}</code><br><code>Segment 4: {-6.2434893, 106.8029214,-6.2433926, 106.8030539}</code><br><code>Segment 5: {-6.2433926, 106.8030539,-6.2436018, 106.8032224}</code></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://gojek-ghost.zysk.in/content/images/2020/05/image-1.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><h3 id=\"the-initial-setup\">The initial setup</h3><p>When the user lands on the live tracking screen, the app immediately makes a call to our internal API to get the driver location and route. Once we get this data, we plot it on the map using the standard GoogleMap methods. <code><em><em>googleMap.addMarker()</em></em></code><em><em>, </em></em><code><em><em>googleMap.addPolyline()</em></em></code> etc.</p><p>Sometimes, we don‚Äôt have the routing information available immediately, so we just show the driver marker. We also store this data locally in an in-memory cache as we would need it later to do some comparisons.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/436/1*k9IpgQ4ss-bhKHBY5ETUgg.gif\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>So, the customer is able to see the markers and routes on the map now. So far so good.</p><h3 id=\"the-subsequent-updates\">The subsequent updates</h3><p>As I mentioned earlier, we need to change the position of driver marker and route as the driver moves. The customer app makes a call to the same internal API every few seconds. After the first response, we don‚Äôt move any markers or routes on the map until the next response succeeds.</p><p>In the next response, we again get the same data points i.e the route and driver location but with different values, of course, <strong><strong>if the driver has moved</strong></strong>. The next set of data that we get can have the following characteristics:</p><ol><li>Route and driver location don‚Äôt change</li><li>Route changes</li><li>Route doesn‚Äôt change BUT driver location does</li></ol><p>Let‚Äôs discuss these cases one by one.</p><h3 id=\"1-route-and-driver-location-don-t-change\">1: Route and driver location don‚Äôt change</h3><p>If nothing has changed, we don‚Äôt need to do anything. Probably our driver partner is stuck in traffic. üòû</p><h3 id=\"2-route-changes\">2: Route changes</h3><p>This can happen either when:</p><ol><li>The app was not showing any route to the user before i.e the first response didn‚Äôt have the route.</li><li>The app was showing a route that is different from the newly received route. This usually happens in cases where the driver starts following a different route from the one they were following before. This can also happen due to road closures or simply because our driver-partner initially followed a wrong route by mistake üòÖ.</li></ol><p>In either of these cases, we simply ignore the old driver marker and routes which were shown and plot the new marker and routes.</p><h3 id=\"3-route-doesn-t-change-but-driver-location-does\">3: Route doesn‚Äôt change BUT driver location does</h3><p>The app was showing the same route to the user before i.e the old response had the same route as the new response. This means that the driver is following the original route that we determined.</p><p>In this case, we need to animate the driver marker on the map from the old location to the new location along the same route. This is the most common scenario, which can again be broken down further into multiple scenarios (yeah, I‚Äôm all about breaking things down ü§ê).</p><h3 id=\"3-1-does-the-new-location-lie-on-the-route\">3.1: Does the new location lie on the route?</h3><p>To animate the driver marker from it‚Äôs current position to the new location, we first need to know whether the new location lies on the route or not.</p><p>Yeah, we can‚Äôt be sure that the driver location that we have received would always lie on the route/road because of various GPS inaccuracy issues.</p><p>We iterate through every segment in the route to find the segment which has the new location. For every segment, we use the Geometry/PolyUtil library to determine whether the driver location lies on that route.</p><p>We also specify a tolerance of a few meters to account for GPS inaccuracy. So, if the newly received location is within a radius of <strong><strong>X meters</strong></strong> near a segment, this method will return true.</p><p><strong><strong>Android</strong></strong></p><p><code>boolean isLocationOnPath(LatLng point,List&lt;LatLng&gt; polyline,boolean geodesic, double tolerance)</code></p><p><strong><strong>iOS</strong></strong></p><p><code>BOOL <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios-sdk/reference/group___geometry_utils#ga580ba381b9d4fbc0ff430cf69e06e66d\" rel=\"noopener\">GMSGeometryIsLocationOnPathToleranc</a>e(CLLocationCoordinate2D point,<a href=\"https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios-sdk/reference/interface_g_m_s_path\" rel=\"noopener\">GMSPath</a> * path,BOOL geodesic,CLLocationDistance tolerance)</code></p><p>If the location doesn‚Äôt lie on any of the segments in the route, we are sad and so, we don‚Äôt animate anything.

Here the distance is not the straight line distance b/w the two points that we have to animate through.</p><p>This is the total distance along the route <strong><strong>from</strong></strong> the segment that the old driver location is currently located at, <strong><strong>to</strong></strong> the segment where the new driver location is. Yeah, that statement is a bit confusing. So, let‚Äôs take an example.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://gojek-ghost.zysk.in/content/images/2020/05/image-8.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>The car icon(A) represents the location in the segment where the driver marker currently is. The red pin(X) represents the new snapped location received. To calculate the distance, we do the obvious:</p><p><code>Total distance = d1 + d2 + d3 + d4</code></p><p>Now, we have the distance. We need the time interval.</p><p>The <code>FusedLocationProvider</code> API in the driver app does provide us the timestamp at which a location was updated. And this information is passed to our backend and subsequently to the customer app.</p><p>We calculate the time difference b/w the old driver location and the new driver location using their timestamps. Wait, how do we know the old driver location? As we had mentioned earlier, we cache the last available driver location and route in an in-memory cache.</p><p>Total route distance divided by time and now we have the speed for the entire duration. Linear distance divided by this speed and now we have the <strong><strong>duration</strong></strong>for a single animation in a segment. Cool, so let‚Äôs get back to the point where we broke off üòÖ.</p><h1 id=\"update-the-animation\">Update the animation</h1><p>With all the above information, we start the animation. But wait? Aren‚Äôt we missing something? We did start an animation b/w two points but how will our animator know <strong><strong>how</strong></strong> to animate?</p><p>Animation is just a bunch of frame updates that happen every fast. How do we update the marker position, the starting point of the route, the rotation in each and every frame of the animation? Well, the mobile/web framework allows us to do something every time the frame is updated.</p><p>But what is this something that we should do?</p><h2 id=\"1-update-marker-s-position\">1. Update marker‚Äôs position</h2><p>For markers, we need to update their position. Once we have the position, we can simply update the marker position using the <code>marker.setPosition()</code>. To find the position during each frame of the animation, we need the percentage of animation that has elapsed.</p><p>We can get the percentage from the Animation framework. Using this percentage and the start and end position, we calculate the intermediate position/s like this:</p><p><code>SphericalUtil.interpolate(startPosition, endPosition, fraction)</code></p><h2 id=\"2-update-routes\">2. Update Routes</h2><p>Routes need to be aligned with the marker‚Äôs movement. So, we update the routes as well using the values above and updating the polyline points of that route using the <code>polyline.setPoints()</code><em><em>.</em></em></p><p>And that‚Äôs a wrap. The result that we get is a very smooth, measured movement of the vehicle along the road.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/600/1*EtoKV1x7ufBgxOPdcsvnJg.gif\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>There are a few more tips/tricks that we employ to ensure that there are no abrupt changes in the animation.</p><p>But that‚Äôs for next time. üòÉ</p><h3 id=\"what-s-next\">What‚Äôs next?</h3><p>We still need to go a long way to meet the standards that we have set for ourselves. Currently, this new experience is only rolled out to GoRide, GoCar, and GoBluebird. We are working on bringing the same experience to other services like GoFood, GoSend, and GoShop.

As our previous research has explained, we first perform \nclustering\n[https://blog.gojekengineering.com/fantastic-drivers-and-how-to-find-them-a88239ef3b29] \non historical bookings to form potential pickup points, then we use a language\nmodel\n[https://blog.gojekengineering.com/how-i-met-my-gojek-driver-without-a-single-call-95041f4fdd03] \nto select the best name. Here, we explain how we improved upon the previous\nstatistical language model with a state-of-the-art NLP model, which makes the\nentire naming exercise fully scalable. This is the magic behind all the pickup\npoints seen on the Gojek app.\n\nHow can we learn better?\nAs explained in our previous post, our original statistical language model\nselects the best pickup point name from the most probable n-grams extracted from\nbookings text. However, such a statistical language model doesn‚Äôt ‚Äòunderstand‚Äô\nthe meaning of the texts, it simply chooses phrases with high frequencies\nwithout knowing the semantics. Sometimes it throws street names, sometimes even\ncommon phrases with no information about location. We have to manually check\neverything to make sure it reflects the right POI, before it appears on the app.\n\nThis creates a challenge ‚Äî especially if we want to quickly expand the\nfrictionless pickup experience to customers across in new geographies. Hence, we\ndecided to go a step further with a deep-learning NLP model that ‚Äòunderstands‚Äô\nand ‚Äòlearns‚Äô to differentiate what is a valid pickup point name.\n\nAt Gojek, we never stop thinking and always go a step further\n\nMeet CartoBERT ?\nOne of the most recent and impactful breakthroughs NLP was the publication of\nBERT[1] ‚Äî a contextual language representation with transformer models ‚Äî by\nGoogle in late 2018. It obtained state-of-the-art results on a wide array of NLP\ntasks. In the 2019, many NLP researches were influenced by BERT, including\nXLNet, RoBERTa, ERNIE etc.\n\nBERT Explained\nBERT, or Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, is composed of\nan embedding layer, followed by groups of transformer layers.\n\nEvery word (token) in the input sentence will first get encoded into its\nembedding representations in the embedding layer, and then go through\nbidirectional transformer encoder layers. Every encoder layer will perform the\nmulti-head attention computation on the token representation from the previous\nlayer to create a new intermediate representation, which is then output to the\nnext layer. The output from the final layer is the contextual representation of\nthe input token. A pooled sentence level representation combining all token\nrepresentations could be created if needed by specific downstream tasks.\n\nWith the final contextual representations at either token or sentence level, a\npre-trained BERT on large unlabelled text corpus, could be further extended to a\nwide variety of NLP tasks, such as text classification, question answering,\nNamed Entity Recognition (NER) etc.\n\nALBERT[2], published by Google in Sep 2019, improved on BERT with embedding\nparameter factorisation and cross layer parameter sharing to reduce the number\nof parameters (by 9 times for base model). It also uses sequence order\nprediction instead of next sentence prediction for the pre-train task. In the\npaper, ALBERT also outperforms BERT on standard NLP tasks/datasets (SQUAD, RACE\netc), with fewer parameters.\n\nPre-train CartoBERT to learn language representation from Gojek bookings text\nInspired by ALBERT‚Äôs lightweight model and performance, we developed CartoBERT,\nGojek‚Äôs very own pickup point name recognition model, based on ALBERT‚Äôs\narchitecture.\n\nAs illustrated below, the uncased CartoBERT is pre-trained on Gojek‚Äôs own masked\nbookings text corpus of about 200 million sentences. Booking text is first\npre-processed for data masking to mask all customer sensitive information,\nlanguage detection, text normalisation (including text cleaning, slang,\nabbreviation transformations, lowercase transformation and emoji removal). The\npre-processed text is used to build subword vocabularies which handles\nOut-Of-Vocabulary (OOV) tokens that could be decomposed to frequent subword\npatterns. CartoBERT tokenizer is then created with the subword vocabularies and\nfurther used to encode and tokenize the same preprocessed bookings text to form\npre-trained input files.\n\nSame as ALBERT, the model is pre-trained to ‚Äòunderstand‚Äô Gojek‚Äôs bookings text\nusing Masked Language Model ‚Äî which predicts randomly masked tokens in input\nsentences ‚Äî and Sentence Order Prediction tasks, which predicts the order of\ninput sentences pair.\n\nFine-tuning CartoBERT to extract pickup point names from Gojek bookings text\nWith the huge amount of bookings text we have at Gojek, now CartoBERT can better\n‚Äòunderstand‚Äô past bookings text. Theoretically, it ‚Äòunderstands‚Äô every word of a\nbooking text sentence.\n\nFor every token in the input sentence, CartoBERT will output a 768-dimension\nvector (we use the default hidden layer size of the ALBERT base model in\nCartoBERT, however this is configurable) from last transformer encoder layer,\nand we use that to represent CartoBERT‚Äôs ‚Äòunderstanding‚Äô of the token‚Äôs meaning\nin the sentence context for fine-tune step.\n\nAs illustrated in the diagram below, while fine-tuning CartoBERT for pickup\npoint name recognition, we replace the Masked Language Model and Sequence Order\nPrediction layers from CartoBERT in pre-train step with token classification\nlayer. The token classification layer learns to predict the probability of a\ntoken belonging to a pickup point name, with the final token representation\noutput from CartoBERT transformer layers, from labelled training data created\nwith bookings text sentences, and corresponding pickup point names. Here, we use\nweighted cross entropy loss to deal with class imbalance, as tokens tagged to\npickup point names are a minority.\n\n\n\nWith this, CartoBERT is fine-tuned to extract pickup point names from bookings\ntext sentences, if any.\n\nHow does the model perform?\nCartoBERT gives a lift of more than 25% in pickup point name accuracy to ~93%\naccuracy, which is measured as the percentage of valid pick up point names out\nof generated names. With this high accuracy, we have achieved full scalability\nof automatic generation for named pickup points to quickly cover multiple\ngeographies without heavy reliance on human inputs.\n\nWhat‚Äôs next?\nWe are not stopping here and are exploring using active learning to further\nimprove CartoBERT. With active learning, we only flag out uncertain predictions,\nwhich are measured as sentence level least token probability[3] for human\nlabelling. We then use human-curated data as feedback for model learning. In\nthis way, we can improve model learning efficiency with minimum labelling\neffort.\n\nWhat‚Äôs more, with the success of CartoBERT, we are considering pre-training and\nopen sourcing a general Indonesia Bahasa ALBERT model with Indonesia open corpus\nfrom wiki, news, Twitter etc. Currently, the options for open-sourced language\nmodel in Indonesia Bahasa are very limited, only pre-trained static word\nembeddings such as word2vec, fasttext etc are available. It would be beneficial\nto the community if we have a good state-of-the-art attention-based transformer\nmodel for the language.

Thinking about burgers and crispy chicken fritters\nwith creamy sauces sitting on a warm, soft bun? At least, that‚Äôs what I am\nthinking about. May be you‚Äôre different. Vegan perhaps? Or craving noodles? Each\nof us turn into a different person when we are hungry, and this is the story\nabout how GoFood ‚Äî Gojek‚Äôs food delivery service ‚Äî helps you find the bite you\ncrave.\n\n> At the core of the food ordering experience, sits search.\nSearches are part of so many of our interactions on web and mobile, that we\ndon‚Äôt even notice it anymore. This is mostly because modern search engines have\nmatured to a point where they can deliver high quality results even if the\nentered query is a weak signal of the user‚Äôs intent. Even when weak, every query\nstill contains a piece of the user‚Äôs intent.\n\nIn the case of GoFood, that piece is a fragment of our user‚Äôs hunger-driven\nbrain.\n\nIn this post, we‚Äôll discuss how we personalise the search results we surface on\nGoFood, based on the information we have about our users‚Äô food preferences.\n\nHow Each of Us Differ\nLet‚Äôs look at two of our GoFood users who have started feeling the pangs of\nhunger, and come online to check restaurants near them.\n\nThey both open our app and click on the NEAR ME tile that lets users find the\nrestaurants near them. We show them the nearest restaurants first, and this is\nwhat they both see.\n\n\nThis list goes on and on and will let them see each restaurant which is farther\nand farther away. They can now peruse the menus of each restaurant and pick one\nthat serves what they feel like ordering. The problem is that they may spend\nsome time scrolling and then leave the app without being able to make up their\nminds around which restaurant to place an order from. We have thrown too many\nchoices at them and the cognitive effort of picking a restaurant and then a dish\nfrom the menu is too much work to make them suffer through.\n\nBut wait. Both Mila and Husain have transacted with us in the past, and we know\na fair bit about their preferences. ü§î\n\nTo make this experience better, we decided to build a system that would let both\nof them see restaurants that suit their own tastes and preferences\n\nApplying Machine Learning to the Problem\nRanking documents for relevance works by assigning a prediction score to each\ndocument retrieved, which is directly proportional to its relevance. In the case\nof NEAR ME restaurant ranking this can be something like:\n\n> Relevance score = 2 * (1/distance) + 1.2 * rating of restaurant\nHere in the relevance score calculation, we are taking weighted sum of different\nfactors like (1/distance) and rating of restaurant. The coefficients/weights of\nthese factors can be arrived at by experimenting with them and choosing weights\nthat seem to maximise the ordering conversions. But, in the case of restaurant\nranking in GoFood, we want to take into consideration many factors when deciding\nrelevance. Unfortunately, experimenting with combinations of all those factors\nis impossible.\n\nEnter Learning to rank. Here, the problem of deciding the rank of the\nrestaurants shown to the user is formulated as a supervised machine learning\nproblem.\n\nIf we look at past search, click, and ordering data, we will be able to assign\nrelevance judgements to each restaurant listing according to whether our users\nclicked or ordered from one of those restaurants. Restaurants that attracted\nhigher degrees of interest will be given higher degrees of relevance.\n\nIn the below example, a relevance judgement level of 0,1 and 2 is assigned to a\nrestaurant according to whether the user viewed, clicked, or ordered from the\nrestaurant in the search result. The relevance judgements are relative and only\nintent to be monotonically increasing with increasing relevance . They say that\nthe restaurant which the user created an order from is more relevant than a\nrestaurant the user merely checked out by clicking on it. They don‚Äôt mean that\nthe restaurant which received the order is twice as relevant .\n\nThe values of each of the factors that could have played a role in the user‚Äôs\ndecision of clicking or ordering is also shown against the restaurants.\n\nThree of the factors/features in the above example are marked as\n‚Äòpersonalisation features‚Äô because they would change according to the user‚Äôs\nprevious order history and location. These will be the features that will be\ndifferent between Mila and Husain because of the differences in the restaurants\nand cuisines they have ordered from before in the past.\n\n> These personalisation features are at the crux of creating personalised\nexperiences for each user\nOther customer agnostic features/factors like the rating, price range, and\npopularity of the restaurant are also listed here. GoFood has millions of such\nexamples where users with different tastes made different decisions when shown a\nset of search results. These examples can now be used to create a dataset from\nwhich the learning to rank ML algorithm can create a model to decide how\nrelevant a GoFood user would find a restaurant given that user‚Äôs location, order\nhistory and other restaurant statistics.\n\nHow We Ranked\nOne way to approach this was as a point-wise ranking problem, wherein we try to\npredict the relevance judgement of each restaurant. Based on this, later we will\npredict the relevance judgement level and sort restaurants in decreasing order\nof predicted relevance score. This approach reduces learning to rank problem to\na regression problem.\n\nAnother approach was to solve it is a pairwise ranking problem, wherein the ML\nmodel is trying to learn how to get the order of a pair of restaurants correct\ni.e if Restaurant A is more preferable to Restaurant B , the order (Restaurant\nA, Restaurant B) is correct and the order (Restaurant B, Restaurant A) is wrong.\n\nFor an ML model to be learned, we need an objective function that captures this\npairwise ordering formulation . This is called a loss function or error function\nin ML and is the measure through which an ML model can assess how right or wrong\nits decision was. In pairwise ranking , this should be a function that becomes\nhigher whenever the model misjudges a preference order and becomes lower when it\nis right about the preference order.\n\nThe loss/error function C is explained below:\n\nWhen this function is minimised, the model is trying to predict a score for each\nrestaurant such that the ranking of the order of the restaurants are close the\nrelevance judgements the users made.\n\nThe pairwise formulation is a better approach here in comparison to the\npoint-wise approach as it is looking to get the order of restaurants right and\nis not trying to estimate the relevance score themselves whose values were\nassigned only as markers to show how some restaurants were more preferred\nrelative to others.\n\nWe used an implementation of the LambdaMART algorithm that learns to predict\nrelevance scores so as to minimise this pairwise loss. You can think of this as\na pursuit to find the decision tree that takes in all the parameters of the\nrestaurant and gives out a score to the restaurant . This score should be\nassigned in such a way as to make the pair orders right.\n\nOnce this model is trained, it can be used during search, as explained in this\npost\n[https://blog.gojekengineering.com/how-the-gojek-butler-serves-a-gourmet-meal-to-our-users-4a161d83052a?source=friends_link&sk=42397976fe914a418ac40f19545f90b7]\n.\n\nNow let‚Äôs go back to our beloved customers ‚Äî Mila and Husain. The next time Mila\nor Husain looks for restaurants near them, the search results they see will be\naccording to their preferences. This is because the model would look at the\nnumber of times they have ordered from each of the restaurants near them before.\nIt would take their preferred cuisines and factors like restaurant ratings into\naccount, and show them the restaurants that they would prefer to order from\nfirst.\n\nThe different search results Mila and Husain get after learning to rank is used\nto re-rank the results are shown below.\n\nWe ran an AB test using this formulation of learning to rank and observed a\nrelative lift of 20% in search to ordering conversions and 23% improvement in\nNDCG. More information on how this metric is calculated here\n[https://blog.gojekengineering.com/is-this-what-you-were-looking-for-439bf012cca6?source=friends_link&sk=bdc1310acc3b6a8270f10284cb30fa53]\n.\n\nWhat We Learned\nOne interesting thing we observed as we started experimenting with this learning\nto rank model was personalising search results led to the average position at\nwhich the search to order conversions happen to be much higher on the list. This\nis because users were increasingly seeing the restaurants that they have some\naffinity towards and were able to make an ordering decision without scrolling\nmuch and without spending too much time being confused where to order from.\n\nSo that‚Äôs how we rank restaurant pairs with respect to relevance based on\navailable user data.

Our batch\npipelines process billions of data points periodically, in order to help our\nbusiness teams gather an effective view of data.\n\nThis post explains our approach to building batch pipelines that leverage\ncomplex data in an efficient way.\n\nI will start by providing some context on our data warehouse and the data we\nstore in it, and explain the use cases of batch processing that we tackle at\nGojek. Then we‚Äôll talk about how we tackle running batch processing jobs and\nhandling scheduling dependencies.\n\nData Warehouse setup\nAt Gojek, we use Google Bigquery (BQ) as a Data Warehouse. All data points\nranging from booking and searches to location are published in real time using \nBeast [https://github.com/gojek/beast], our open-sourced tool.\n\nWe also push data from Kafka to our data lake, which is Google Cloud\nStorage(GCS). These data points vary in terms of the data format (which might\nnot be relevant to the analysts). They need to gather insights from the data\nwithout needing to know how it is stored.\n\n> To solve this, we wanted to create an abstraction such that the users of data\nonly need to know about the constitution of data, and not about where the data\nis coming from or what format the data is stored.\nBatch processing use cases\nTypical use cases of batch processing at Gojek revolve around enriching\nreal-time data with additional data points mined from huge amounts of historical\ndata.\n\nA few examples of use cases include:\n\nCreating a customer profile:\n\nIn order to provide our customers with the most relevant discount and deal\nvouchers, we enrich customer profiles with the last few months of the customer‚Äôs\norder and search history. This enables our team of data analysts and data\nscientists to experiment with customer segmentation and targeting. This use case\nhas been covered in much detail by my colleague Mayank in this blog\n[https://blog.gojekengineering.com/how-we-solved-user-selection-to-help-merchants-win-business-519fe5085a0e]\n.\n\nPersonalising search results:\n\nIn order to personalise the search results served up by our food delivery app\nGoFood, we leverage batch processing to gather insights about trending, popular,\nand highly-rated restaurants near the user that match their taste profile. More\ndetails around how we went about this use case are covered in this blog\n[https://blog.gojekengineering.com/how-the-gojek-butler-serves-a-gourmet-meal-to-our-users-4a161d83052a]\n.\n\nRunning Batch pipelines\nAs I previously mentioned, the users of data usually don‚Äôt need to know the\nformat in which the data is stored.

Then we‚Äôll talk about how we tackle running batch processing jobs and handling scheduling dependencies.</p><h1 id=\"data-warehouse-setup\">Data Warehouse setup</h1><p>At Gojek, we use Google Bigquery (BQ) as a Data Warehouse. All data points ranging from booking and searches to location are published in real time using <a href=\"https://github.com/gojek/beast\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong><strong>Beast</strong></strong></a><strong><strong>, </strong></strong>our open-sourced tool.</p><p>We also push data from Kafka to our data lake, which is Google Cloud Storage(GCS). These data points vary in terms of the data format (which might not be relevant to the analysts). They need to gather insights from the data without needing to know how it is stored.</p><blockquote><em><em>To solve this, we wanted to create an abstraction such that the users of data only need to know about the constitution of data, and not about where the data is coming from or what format the data is stored.</em></em></blockquote><h1 id=\"batch-processing-use-cases\"><strong>Batch processing use cases</strong></h1><p>Typical use cases of batch processing at Gojek revolve around enriching real-time data with additional data points mined from huge amounts of historical data.</p><p>A few examples of use cases include:</p><p><strong><strong>Creating a customer profile:</strong></strong></p><p>In order to provide our customers with the most relevant discount and deal vouchers, we enrich customer profiles with the last few months of the customer‚Äôs order and search history.

They help us validate our hypotheses without\nhaving to involve our entire user base. However, any good experiment first\nrequires the answer to the question ‚Äî how do we know the right number of people\nto include in it?\n\nLet‚Äôs break down why this is important. If we target too few, our experiments\nwill not detect smaller effects, leading us to miss legitimate opportunities. If\nwe target too many, we would be wasting resources and potentially hurting our\nbusiness metrics (if the treatments turn out to be detrimental).\n\nPreviously, we used simple heuristics (and a mysterious formula) to estimate the\nrequired sample size. These practices were not very scientific and produced\ninconsistent experimental results. To compensate, we had to repeat the same\nexperiment multiple times just to validate the results. Sometimes different\niterations would conflict with each other, leaving everyone scratching their\nheads.\n\nLast year, we ditched those unscientific practices and built a new tool called\nSample Size Calculator (yes, imaginative name, we know). This post explains how\nthe calculator helps us find the right number of people to include in\nexperiments.\n\nOur calculator is based on Frequentist school of statistics. Under the hood, we\nused both the pwr\n[https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pwr/vignettes/pwr-vignette.html] \npackage and the base sample size calculation functions in R programming\nlanguage. This is what the tool looks like:\n\nFigure 1. Screenshot of the Sample Size Calculator used at GojekThe most\nimportant parameters are the type of dependent variable measured, the historical\ndata, and the required sensitivity from the experiment. As you can see in the\ngraph, if we increase sensitivity to allow detection of smaller effects, the\nrequired sample size soars, which makes sense.\n\nAlthough this is a major step in the right direction, there is a problem if we\nare interested in a continuous dependent variable for our experiment. This is\nbecause the underlying methodology used in the calculator assumes a normal\ndistribution, while most continuous metrics that we care about at Gojek ‚Äî such\nas bookings per user ‚Äî are usually skewed. By ‚Äòskewed‚Äô, we mean that most users\nare light users and only a small percentage are heavy users. This could cause\nthe computed sample size requirement to be wrong because a key assumption was\nnot met.\n\nWe have four options to deal with this problem:\n\n 1. Use a methodology that doesn‚Äôt assume normality. Unfortunately, the\n    available non-parametric methods are complex to implement [1\n    [http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~ejohnson/regression/Sample%20Size%20Power%20Considerations.pdf]\n    ] [2 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4423589/]]\n 2. Transform data to have a normal distribution. This doesn‚Äôt always work ‚Äî\n    some data just can‚Äôt be coerced to normal\n 3. Use a larger sample size. Since the worry is lower power than expected,\n    simple multiplication should boost the power, but the multiplier needs to be\n    reasonable. Figuring the right multiplier would be another beast on its own\n 4. Ignore it. This is the path we took\n\n> But but but‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs not scientific!\nDon‚Äôt worry. We tested the robustness of this solution before going ahead with\nit.\n\nAs you can see in the graph below, we created two right-skewed distributions\nwith known 5% difference in means to serve as our populations. The plan is to\ncontinuously sample from this population (equivalent to replicating the same\nexperiment many times) and see how often we can detect this 5% difference (aka\nwhat is our ‚Äúpower [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_(statistics)]‚Äù).\n\nFigure 2. Two right-skewed distributions (typical shape for continuous metric at\nGojek) with known mean difference (lift) of 5%The first step is to calculate the\nrequired sample size with a power of 80% and minimum detectable effect of 5%.\nLet‚Äôs refer to this sample size requirement as the ‚Äúexact‚Äù size. Then we divide\nand multiply it by three and call them ‚Äúless‚Äù and ‚Äúmore‚Äù, respectively. For each\nsample size, we sample from the populations, compute the mean difference\n(typically called ‚Äúlift‚Äù), and repeat this procedure many times.\n\nThe resulting distributions of lifts are shown below. The coloured vertical\nlines show the average lift of each experimental size, which is also equal to\nthe actual population lift. This is central limit theorem\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem] at work. What is\ninteresting are the relative shapes of the sampling distributions. The ‚Äúmore‚Äù\ngroup is the safest and most consistent but the ‚Äúexact‚Äù group seems to have good\naccuracy with only a third of the sample size. In the ‚Äúless‚Äù group, we even see\na non-negligible number of lifts that are negative, even though we know the\npopulation lift is actually +5%. This is in line with our intuition that larger\nsample size is generally more trustworthy than a smaller one, all else being\nequal.\n\nFigure 3. Sampling distribution of the mean difference from each size groupSince\nwe currently report the statistical significance of our experimental results at\nGojek, we will also run t-test for each of our sample here.\n\nAs it turns out, 80.4% of the experiments in the ‚Äúexact‚Äù group have\nstatistically significant results (p < 0.05), which is almost equal to the 80%\npower we set in the sample size calculator. In layman‚Äôs terms, the tool roughly\npromised that if you run the experiment with this sample size, you have 80%\nchance of detecting a 5% lift (the minimum detectable effect) if it‚Äôs there.\n\nSince it kept its promise even on non-normally distributed data, we can conclude\nthat the methodology is robust to some degree of violation of the normality\nassumption. Therefore we can ignore it until otherwise proven.\n\nFigure 4. Percentage of samples/experiments with statistically significant\nresults (p < 0.05) from each size groupMeanwhile, the ‚Äúless‚Äù group had only ~34%\nstatistically significant results, suggesting that we shouldn‚Äôt run an\nexperiment if we cannot fulfil the sample size requirement ‚Äî since we risk not\nbeing able to detect an existing effect. With the ‚Äúmore‚Äù group having close to\n100% statistically significant results, we again reaffirm that larger sample\nsize is generally a good thing if we can afford it.\n\nSince it was deployed in mid-2018, many teams across Gojek have adopted the\nSample Size Calculator. So far, nearly 1,000 experiments have incorporated this\ntool in their designs, and it is also a part of Litmus, our experimentation\nplatform\n[https://blog.gojekengineering.com/introducing-litmus-gojeks-own-experimentation-platform-3803467b6a53]\n. The more critical takeaway for us is that the experiments run using the\nrecommended sample sizes have similar results when full-scaled. This fact has\nenabled us to iterate faster and cut waste while maintaining a high degree of\nconfidence in the experimental results. ‚úåÔ∏è\n\nDid we mention Gojek‚Äôs Growth team is hiring analysts?

Here‚Äôs\nwhat‚Äôs different:\n\nThere are two subtle changes ‚Äî the colour of the button is a different shade of\ngreen and the elevation is also different.\n\nIn Asphalt\n[https://blog.gojekengineering.com/ux-engineering-at-gojek-9de2abe24928], our\ndesign language system, we want to make sure our UI components are robust and\ndetect breakages early. Here‚Äôs how we leveraged screenshot tests to achieve\nthis.\n\nComponents Everywhere\nAsphalt Components in Gojek appWith Asphalt, we create components that can be\nreused across the Gojek app. Every button, text, input, or card which you see in\nmost of the screens of the app is an Asphalt Component. On top of this, we have\na demo app which showcases the usage of these components.\n\nAsphalt Components in Demo appOur components are the backbone of the Gojek app\nUI. For example, our button class has 300+ occurrences across Gojek‚Äôs consumer\napp codebase. This heavy reuse helps us enforce design guidelines across the\napp. The importance of these components requires that we test them thoroughly,\nas even a small regression in one component could mean a degraded experience for\nour users.\n\n[U]n[I]t Testing\nUnit tests are supposed to test logic and fail when expectations aren‚Äôt met. How\ndo we expect that a certain UI is being rendered properly?\n\nThe idea of screenshot testing is to have a master copy of screenshots that we\nknow are correct and on every test run compare the current screenshots to the\nmaster copy. If the current set does not match the master set, the test fails.\nThis will allow us to check unintentional UI changes. If the changes are\nintentional, then we run the tests in update mode which updates the master\nscreenshots.\n\nHere is the high level outline:\n\n> - Write Espresso test for all activities in the demo\n> - Take screenshots and create a master set\n> - At every CI run take screenshots again and compare with master set\nWe started out with Shot [https://github.com/Karumi/Shot], an open source\nlibrary which allows us to take screenshots and compare them using gradle\ncommands and generate reports.\n\nHere‚Äôs what a test for our Alert component looks like üëá\n\nAchilles Heel ‚Äî The Android Emulator\nWhile the Android emulator has improved a lot in recent times, we found running\nemulators in CI is still unreliable.\n\nHere are a few issues we faced:\n\n> - We had to wait to for the emulator to start up, which was only possible\nthrough a hack(y) script by continuously pinging adb commands\n> Emulator would put more memory pressure on CI runners\n> Emulators also need hardware acceleration which required us to enable kvm on our\nLinux-based machines.\nRunning Instrumentation test cases with these issues would mean our tests would\nbe flaky ‚Äî and we couldn‚Äôt have that.\n\nFirebase Test Lab saves the day!\nWe decide to move away from emulators to real devices.\n\nOne idea was to have devices connected to a machine and use the machine as a\nrunner for running test cases in CI ‚Äî a device test lab.\n\nBut devices come with their own baggage ‚Äî maintaining them. They may be\ninterrupted by software updates, system dialogs‚Ä¶ or get overcharged and explode!\nüî•\n\nWe found the next best thing: Firebase Test Lab\n[https://firebase.google.com/docs/test-lab] ‚Äî a set of devices in cloud, managed\nautomatically and available via CLI.\n\nThis solved our device problem, but we ran into another one ‚Äî Firebase Test Lab\ndoesn‚Äôt allow you to run custom gradle commands. Instead, it expects you to\nupload a debug and a test apk, and it will run the tests for you. This meant we\ncould no longer use Shot for taking screenshots and comparing them üò¶\n\nWhile scratching our heads over how to overcome this problem, we found that\nFirebase Test Lab allows you\n[https://firebase.google.com/docs/test-lab/android/test-screenshots] to take\nscreenshots through a library and then retrieve them from Google Cloud Bucket.\n\nThere is also a gradle plugin [https://github.com/runningcode/fladle/] which\nautomates this process including downloading artifacts from GCP ‚Äî open source to\nthe rescue again!\n\nHere‚Äôs how our test case looks like with Firebase screenshot library:\n\nFor image comparison we used ImageMagick [https://imagemagick.org/], a very\npopular and feature-packed CLI tool for image manipulation. It also allows us to\noutput a different image in case two images don‚Äôt match, which is super useful\nfor generating test failure reports.\n\nThe final piece ‚Äî integrating screenshot tests into our developer workflow\nAs part of CI, we do the following things when a merge request is raised:\n\n> - Build the project\n> - Run Espresso Tests on Firebase Test Lab\n> - Retrieve screenshots and compare them with master set\n> - If any screenshot doesn‚Äôt match, we fail the build and add a comment to PR\nusing Danger [https://danger.systems/]\nDanger reporting mismatch in screenshot along with diff image.We have been using\nthis setup for some time now, and it‚Äôs worked out great for us! We have been\nable to execute multiple UI refactors with high confidence.\n\nWhat‚Äôs next?\nWe will continue to invest in this setup in the future. Things like testing\nlocalisation, having a test matrix with multiple screen sizes, API levels,\ndevice densities‚Ä¶ these are some things we have planned for the future.\n\nA big thank you to the open source libraries that helped us achieve this!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLiked what you read?

If the changes are intentional, then we run the tests in <code>update</code> mode which updates the master screenshots.</p><p><strong><strong>Here is the high level outline:</strong></strong></p><blockquote><em><em>- Write Espresso test for all activities in the demo</em></em></blockquote><blockquote><em><em>- Take screenshots and create a master set</em></em></blockquote><blockquote><em><em>- At every CI run take screenshots again and compare with master set</em></em></blockquote><p>We started out with <a href=\"https://github.com/Karumi/Shot\" rel=\"noopener\">Shot</a>, an open source library which allows us to take screenshots and compare them using gradle commands and generate reports.</p><p>Here‚Äôs what a test for our Alert component looks like üëá</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><script src=\"https://gist.github.com/jitinsharma/c57e8afbb0b4849ff75a29eeba4dc4d1.js\"></script><!--kg-card-end: html--><h1 id=\"achilles-heel-the-android-emulator\">Achilles Heel ‚Äî The Android Emulator</h1><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*WWyaL1uLibHeXC15.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>While the Android emulator has improved a lot in recent times, we found running emulators in CI is still unreliable.</p><p>Here are a few issues we faced:</p><blockquote><em><em>- We had to wait to for the emulator to start up, which was only possible through a hack(y) script by continuously pinging <code>adb</code> commands</em></em></blockquote><blockquote><em><em>Emulator would put more memory pressure on CI runners</em></em></blockquote><blockquote><em><em>Emulators also need hardware acceleration which required us to enable <code>kvm</code> on our Linux-based machines.</em></em></blockquote><p>Running Instrumentation test cases with these issues would mean our tests would be flaky ‚Äî and we couldn‚Äôt have that.</p><h1 id=\"firebase-test-lab-saves-the-day-\">Firebase Test Lab saves the day!</h1><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0*IIH6x5bWvHn1Gcv_.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>We decide to move away from emulators to real devices.</p><p>One idea was to have devices connected to a machine and use the machine as a runner for running test cases in CI ‚Äî a device test lab.</p><p>But devices come with their own baggage ‚Äî maintaining them.

We moved from an overwhelming single\npage with too much information, to a more intuitive two-step design with a hope\nthat the new design will help our users navigate the flow better (detailed in \npart two [http://bit.ly/2FUiYDo]).\n\nWe rolled out the design to beta on August 12, 2018.\n\nThis is what our redesigned flow looked like?\n\nOne week later:\nA 10% drop in our orders!!?\n\nThat‚Ä¶ did not go according to plan. ?\n\nBut here‚Äôs the fun part: The app worked, and the bookings went through. No major\nout-of-whack tech issues. Yet, there we were, steadily losing orders.\n\nBugs? No.\n\nServer issues? Nope.\n\nDowntime, then? Nuh-uh.\n\nAfter many such questions and no answer, we were left with just one conclusion.\n?\n\nThe design change had made things worse.\n\nJust when I thought my job was done, I realised it was only the beginning. For I\nknew, no solution was good enough until users were successfully using it.\n\nStrap in, we‚Äôre in the Endgame now ?\nPrior to launch, we had rallied the team around a common definition of success ‚Äî\none that was quantifiable and easily measured. 10% drop in our orders did seem\ntragic, but we knew looking at a single metric wasn‚Äôt going to give us the full\nstory.\n\nHence along with defining success metrics for our overall conversions, we also\ndefined and tracked metrics for the smaller tasks, tasks that led the user to\nthe final goal. This helped us monitor whether users were navigating through the\nflow as intended. As a designer it was important to not restrict myself to just\nwireframes and workflows, but participate and know these numbers inside out.\n\n‚ÄúDesigners who are involved in setting success metrics are far better at driving\nimpact than designers who are not‚Äù\n\n‚Äî Julie Zhuo\n\nFocusing on post launch productivity ?\nWhen the overall booking rate dropped, we started digging deeper to find where\nthe frictions were in the flow. We started sifting through the finer details and\nclosely analysed the smaller tasks, the results were a bit surprising.\n\n * By moving the location card to the top, our cancellation rate for wrong\n   address selected dropped by 2% ‚ÄîFirst win‚òùÔ∏è\n * There was no significant drop in the notes or dishes added to the cart. Much\n   to our relief, the new interface was intuitive, users were able to locate the\n   notes button and other dish details‚Äî Second win ‚úåÔ∏è\n * Similar affirmative results with our payments and location card designs too ‚Äî \n   More wins! ?\n * But, there was one issue. Most users who abandoned the flow, left it on the\n   first step itself. Which meant nearly 8% of users did not even land on the\n   second step of the redesigned flow ‚Äî Big Loss ?\n\nOur sanest conclusion was to wait, and give our users some time to get a hang of\nthe new designs. After all, old habits die hard. Thousands of our users who were\npreviously used to a single step now had to break a solid habit.\n\nYes, the old design was unacceptable (well, in the designer world at least ?).\nThe new design ‚Äî despite featuring enhanced UX ‚Äî broke some habits for our\nusers.\n\nA week passed‚Ä¶ then two‚Ä¶\n\nNothing changed. Ô∏è\n\nAfter shuffling through tons of data, we found ourselves with a bunch of\nquestions. Who were the users who abandoned their food at checkout? What were\nthey thinking? Why would they do this?\n\nTo get these answered we coupled our quantitative data with some qualitative\nresearch ‚Äî below are some crude user thoughts ?\n\nThere were two major problems:\n\n 1. Previously used to a single step, users weren‚Äôt prepared for a step 2.\n\n2. Most users added only 1‚Äì2 dishes, and for them the blank white space meant\nloading. Resulting in high uncertainty and agitation ?\n\nHence, most of them were reluctant to click on NEXT with the fear of placing the\norder ‚Äî without them knowing the payment method or location ?\n\nWe were evidently drowning, but before we called for the lifebuoy, we tried to\nswim up ourselves. Not ready to give up on our precious designs, we decided to\nbring down the uncertainty by changing the copy on the button to Proceed To Pay.\nWe hoped this would nudge users to realise there is a step 2 containing payment\ninformation.\n\n\nThe Hail Mary play.Did it work? Did the uncertainty drop?\n\nMuch to our despair‚Ä¶nothing changed, no major impact. Neither were we able to\nbring down the booking time, nor were we able to increase the conversion rate.\nNot even close to what we anticipated.\n\nMurder your darlings ??\nWe had to be more open minded. If most of our users seemed unhappy with the\ndesign. we simply had to change it, Period ‚úã. It was time to hit the dashboards,\nanalyse the problems, and form new ideas for improvements. With the growing\nnumbers, one thing was clear, users wanted to bring back the single page.\n\nFor our final solution we shifted from logic to emotion, focusing more on user‚Äôs\nthoughts and feelings at the time of ordering.\n\nI asked myself, if I were a user and I had to know three things about my order,\nwhat would those be? ? ‚Äî Card sorting came in super handy\n\n * Location Card ‚Äî I want my food to come to me. I am hungry and the last thing\n   I want is my food going to someone else ?. With a drop in the cancellation\n   rate forwrong address selected, we knew retaining location card at the top\n   worked like magic.\n * Dish Card ‚Äî If I am craving for a pizza, I better order the right pizza. \n   Right below the location card was the dish card, helping users easily double\n   check the dishes they added ?\n * Total amount and mode of payment ‚Äî Once I get my pizza, I don‚Äôt want to run\n   around looking for cash. By sticking the total amount and payment method with\n   the order button at bottom of the screen, we saved our users a long scroll.\n   This also created a neat space to surface discounts and savings ?\n\nThe final design was a single page with all three important fields (location,\ndish and payment) above the fold and easily accessible.

We moved from an overwhelming single page with too much information, to a more intuitive two-step design with a hope that the new design will help our users navigate the flow better (detailed in <a href=\"http://bit.ly/2FUiYDo\" rel=\"noopener\">part two</a>).</p><p>We rolled out the design to beta on August 12, 2018.</p><p><strong><strong>This is what our redesigned flow looked like?</strong></strong></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1434/1*wC6FYnnJilFxFkYwab1kLw.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><h2 id=\"one-week-later-\">One week later:</h2><p>A 10% drop in our orders!!?</p><p>That‚Ä¶ did not go according to plan. ?</p><p>But here‚Äôs the fun part: <strong><strong>The app worked, and the bookings went through.</strong></strong> No major out-of-whack tech issues. Yet, there we were, steadily losing orders.</p><p><em><em>Bugs? No.</em></em></p><p><em><em>Server issues? Nope.</em></em></p><p><em><em>Downtime, then? Nuh-uh.</em></em></p><p>After many such questions and no answer, we were left with just one conclusion. ?</p><p><strong><strong>The design change had made things worse.</strong></strong></p><p>Just when I thought my job was done, I realised it was only the beginning. For I knew, no solution was good enough until users were <strong><strong><em><em>successfully</em></em> </strong></strong>using it.</p><h1 id=\"strap-in-we-re-in-the-endgame-now-\">Strap in, we‚Äôre in the Endgame now ?</h1><p>Prior to launch, we had rallied the team around a common definition of success ‚Äî one that was quantifiable and easily measured. 10% drop in our orders did seem tragic, but we knew looking at a single metric wasn‚Äôt going to give us the full story.</p><p>Hence along with defining success metrics for our overall conversions, we also defined and tracked metrics for the smaller tasks, tasks that led the user to the final goal. This helped us monitor whether users were navigating through the flow as intended. As a designer it was important to not restrict myself to just wireframes and workflows, but participate and know these numbers inside out.</p><p>‚ÄúDesigners who are involved in setting success metrics are far better at driving impact than designers who are not‚Äù</p><p>‚Äî Julie Zhuo</p><h1 id=\"focusing-on-post-launch-productivity-\">Focusing on post launch productivity ?</h1><p>When the overall booking rate dropped, we started digging deeper to find where the frictions were in the flow. We started sifting through the finer details and closely analysed the smaller tasks, the results were a bit surprising.</p><ul><li>By moving the location card to the top, our cancellation rate for <code>wrong address selected</code> dropped by 2% ‚Äî<strong><strong>First win</strong></strong>‚òùÔ∏è</li><li>There was no significant drop in the notes or dishes added to the cart.

Thousands of our users who were previously used to a single step now had to break a solid habit.</p><p>Yes, the old design was unacceptable (well, in the designer world at least ?). The new design ‚Äî despite featuring enhanced UX ‚Äî broke some habits for our users.</p><p><strong><strong><em><em>A week passed‚Ä¶ then two‚Ä¶</em></em></strong></strong></p><p>Nothing changed. Ô∏è</p><p>After shuffling through tons of data, we found ourselves with a bunch of questions. W<em><em>ho were the users who abandoned their food at checkout? What were they thinking?

Not ready to give up on our precious designs, we decided to bring down the uncertainty by changing the copy on the button to <code>Proceed To Pay</code>.

With the growing numbers, one thing was clear, users wanted to <strong><strong>bring back the single page.</strong></strong></p><p>For our final solution we shifted from logic to emotion, focusing more on user‚Äôs thoughts and feelings at the time of ordering.</p><p>I asked myself, if I were a user and I had to know three things about my order, what would those be? ? ‚Äî Card sorting came in super handy</p><ul><li><strong><strong>Location Card</strong></strong> ‚Äî I want my food to come to me<strong><strong>. </strong></strong>I am hungry and the last thing I want is my food going to someone else ?.

As a result, even unaffected teams cited in the RCA could analyse\ntheir systems to ensure the same problem would not happen to them. More\nimportantly, it provided a degree of accountability ‚Äî and that‚Äôs important when\nyou have 20+ products.\n\nA post-mortem, and a prevention.\n\nThis post details what happens when a system failure happens at Gojek, and how\nit makes it way into an RCA.\n\n1. The What\nWhen something fails, it is important to understand the origin of the problem.\nEvery team in Gojek sets up alerts which monitor the state of their systems. If\na state change in the system causes a deviation from expected behaviour, an\nalerting service called pager duty automatically dials the phones of the people\nresponsible for that part of the system.\n\nHere‚Äôs an example:\n\nWhen a booking is created, we find a list of driver partners and send the order\ndetails to them, at which point they get a pop-up with trip details like\nestimated duration and approximate earnings. The idea is to give driver partners\nenough information to make the decision to accept the trip. But there was a\nproblem.\n\n2. The Why\nOne of the fields this prompt contains is a Booking ID, which is stored as an\ninteger (which, in technical speak, has a limit of 32 bits). Unfortunately for\nus, the ID generated exceeded this limit.\n\nWelcome to what we call Integer Overflow.\n\nAs a result of this, the driver app started crashing.\n\nHow bad can that be, you ask?\n\n3. The Fallout\nDrivers being unable to use the app means they can‚Äôt accept bookings. This means\ncustomers can‚Äôt book rides, send packages, get food, or use any service that\ndepends on our driver partners.\n\nAs a result, Gojek‚Äôs order numbers (or what we call ‚Äòconcurrence‚Äô, if you want\nto get all technical about it) plummeted. Pager duty is hit, and cell phones\nstart ringing off their proverbial hooks.\n\nWith driver partners stuck with malfunctioning apps, multiple Gojek services\nstart reporting errors. As customers try and figure out why the app is behaving\nthis way, engineers scramble to do the same.\n\n4. The Response\nWhen the phones ring, the team whose alerts have been triggered immediately get\nto work figuring out what happened. If they identify the problem quickly and\ndebug it, they notify other teams. The team then gets to work using information\nfrom the alerts and system dashboards to prepare an RCA.\n\nThis is, of course, the best case scenario.\n\nIf the concerned team cannot find a fix however, a war room is called.\n\nThe war room signifies a larger issue, and members of every available team drop\nwhat they‚Äôre doing and join the call. Sometimes, these are frantic Slack\ndiscussions and calls in the middle of the night. Other times, office boardrooms\nare blocked and everyone gathers to brainstorm collectively.\n\nDevs, Team Leads, Product Managers, all hands on deck.\n\nIn a war room scenario, whoever has most context on the situation takes charge\nand delegates tasks as required. This central person also plays a key role in\ndocumenting the happenings in the war room ‚Äî how many people were present, which\nteams were represented, who was handling what, etc. All this information plays a\nkey role in the RCA. While this is going down, Driver and Customer Care centres\nare also notified, bracing for the inevitable flurry of complaints.\n\nThe fix may take the form of a few simple temporary hacks, or an hours long war\nroom ‚Äî but in the end, there is always a fix.\n\nWords of appreciation from GoPay CEO Aldi Haryopratomo and Gojek CTO Ajey Gore\nAnd a sense of camaraderie üíö\n\nOnce the dust settles, the investigation begins. The person who managed the war\nroom generally authors a document analysing what went wrong, using all the info\nfrom the alerts, dashboards, and firsthand accounts of the responders present.\nTypically every stakeholder in the organisation gets an email the next day with\ndetails of what went wrong ‚Äî the RCA.\n\n5. The Learnings\n‚ÄúCollaborate With Compassion‚Äù\n\nThese three words mean a lot at Gojek, and our RCAs reflect that. When you open\nan RCA mail, there is rarely even a mention of specific people, except to\nacknowledge those who responded to the distress call and played a role in\nfinding a fix. Call out the ones who made the effort, never the ones\nresponsible.\n\nMost RCAs instead dwell on relevant, actionable information. Information that\nwas being collected and monitored right from when the alert tripped:\n\nThe What: What was the problem?\n\nThe Why: Why did it happen?\n\nThe Fallout: Which services were affected, and for how long?\n\nThe Response: How was it fixed?\n\nThe Learnings: What can be done to avoid a repeat of this in future?\n\nThis simple process has helped us scale more safely and efficiently. It also\nallows for early identification of potential vulnerabilities in other systems.\nAs you may have noticed, there is no mention of who was responsible, no finger\npointing, no blame games. Collaborate with compassion.\n\nTo get a better sense of how we write RCAs at Gojek, read a sample RCA\n[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1r_PSsl7mBxbfAcibGTdFpnM5hm6ot82bF-_9VeV2J9w/edit?ts=5db7c330#heading=h.kreykp6cjau6]\n.\n\nIf you‚Äôd like to start a culture of RCAs as well, here‚Äôs our RCA template\n[https://docs.google.com/document/d/12Ims21IwFCNWi9MXcw2TVxPLB6YyWrIoTNaw3P-M_t4/edit]\n, courtesy GoPay CTO Ranjan Sakalley [https://twitter.com/rnjn], who also\noccasionally drops invaluable insights in the ‚ÄòLearnings‚Äô section. üòÖ\n\n\nRCAs have played an integral part in our journey to becoming a SuperApp.\nInvestigating, analysing, and documenting problems in production help us build\nbetter, more scalable systems, and tackle new problems in a mature manner\nwithout fear of retribution.\n\nThe days of weekly production issues are now a thing of the past. While we won‚Äôt\nbe so brash as to say we never have problems, embracing RCAs and a culture of\ncompassionate collaboration have helped us get to where we are today. üôå\n\nWe‚Äôll be writing about more interesting case studies on issues faced in\nproduction.

The What</h3><p>When something fails, it is important to understand the origin of the problem. Every team in Gojek sets up alerts which monitor the state of their systems. If a state change in the system causes a deviation from expected behaviour, an alerting service called <code>pager duty</code> automatically dials the phones of the people responsible for that part of the system.</p><p><strong><strong>Here‚Äôs an example:</strong></strong></p><p>When a booking is created, we find a list of driver partners and send the order details to them, at which point they get a pop-up with trip details like estimated duration and approximate earnings. The idea is to give driver partners enough information to make the decision to accept the trip. But there was a problem.</p><h3 id=\"2-the-why\">2. The Why</h3><p>One of the fields this prompt contains is a Booking ID, which is stored as an integer (which, in technical speak, has a limit of 32 bits). Unfortunately for us, the ID generated exceeded this limit.</p><p>Welcome to what we call Integer Overflow.</p><p>As a result of this, the driver app started crashing.</p><p><strong><strong><em><em>How bad can that be, you ask?</em></em></strong></strong></p><h3 id=\"3-the-fallout\">3. The Fallout</h3><p>Drivers being unable to use the app means they can‚Äôt accept bookings. This means customers can‚Äôt book rides, send packages, get food, or use any service that depends on our driver partners.</p><p>As a result, Gojek‚Äôs order numbers (or what we call ‚Äòconcurrence‚Äô, if you want to get all technical about it) plummeted. Pager duty is hit, and cell phones start ringing off their proverbial hooks.</p><p>With driver partners stuck with malfunctioning apps, multiple Gojek services start reporting errors. As customers try and figure out why the app is behaving this way, engineers scramble to do the same.</p><h3 id=\"4-the-response\">4. The Response</h3><p>When the phones ring, the team whose alerts have been triggered immediately get to work figuring out what happened. If they identify the problem quickly and debug it, they notify other teams. The team then gets to work using information from the alerts and system dashboards to prepare an RCA.</p><p><strong><strong>This is, of course, the best case scenario.</strong></strong></p><p>If the concerned team cannot find a fix however, a war room is called.</p><p>The war room signifies a larger issue, and members of every available team drop what they‚Äôre doing and join the call. Sometimes, these are frantic Slack discussions and calls in the middle of the night. Other times, office boardrooms are blocked and everyone gathers to brainstorm collectively.</p><p><em><em>Devs, Team Leads, Product Managers, all hands on deck.</em></em></p><p>In a war room scenario, whoever has most context on the situation takes charge and delegates tasks as required. This central person also plays a key role in documenting the happenings in the war room ‚Äî <strong><strong>how many people were present, which teams were represented, who was handling what, etc.</strong></strong> <strong><strong>All this information plays a key role in the RCA.</strong></strong> While this is going down, Driver and Customer Care centres are also notified, bracing for the inevitable flurry of complaints.</p><p>The fix may take the form of a few simple temporary hacks, or an hours long war room ‚Äî but in the end, there is always a fix.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1129/1*UFUYfO3Gw9tnKCiE1y40-Q.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\"><figcaption>Words of appreciation from GoPay CEO Aldi Haryopratomo and Gojek CTO Ajey Gore</figcaption></figure><p><em><em>And a sense of camaraderie </em>üíö</em></p><p>Once the dust settles, the investigation begins. The person who managed the war room generally authors a document analysing what went wrong, using all the info from the alerts, dashboards, and firsthand accounts of the responders present. Typically every stakeholder in the organisation gets an email the next day with details of what went wrong ‚Äî the RCA.</p><h3 id=\"5-the-learnings\">5. The Learnings</h3><p>‚ÄúCollaborate With Compassion‚Äù</p><p>These three words mean a lot at Gojek, and our RCAs reflect that. When you open an RCA mail, there is rarely even a mention of specific people, except to acknowledge those who responded to the distress call and played a role in finding a fix. <strong><strong>Call out the ones who made the effort, never the ones responsible.</strong></strong></p><p>Most RCAs instead dwell on relevant, actionable information. Information that was being collected and monitored right from when the alert tripped:</p><p><em><em>The What: What was the problem?</em></em></p><p><em><em>The Why: Why did it happen?</em></em></p><p><em><em>The Fallout: Which services were affected, and for how long?</em></em></p><p><em><em>The Response: How was it fixed?</em></em></p><p><em><em>The Learnings: What can be done to avoid a repeat of this in future?</em></em></p><p>This simple process has helped us scale more safely and efficiently. It also allows for early identification of potential vulnerabilities in other systems. As you may have noticed, there is no mention of who was responsible, no finger pointing, no blame games. <em><em>Collaborate with compassion.</em></em></p><p>To get a better sense of how we write RCAs at Gojek, <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1r_PSsl7mBxbfAcibGTdFpnM5hm6ot82bF-_9VeV2J9w/edit?ts=5db7c330#heading=h.kreykp6cjau6\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong><strong>read a sample RCA</strong></strong></a>.</p><p>If you‚Äôd like to start a culture of RCAs as well, <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/12Ims21IwFCNWi9MXcw2TVxPLB6YyWrIoTNaw3P-M_t4/edit\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong><strong>here‚Äôs our RCA template</strong></strong></a>, courtesy GoPay CTO <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rnjn\" rel=\"noopener\">Ranjan Sakalley</a>, who also occasionally drops invaluable insights in the ‚ÄòLearnings‚Äô section. <strong><strong>üòÖ</strong></strong><br></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/480/1*2sosYEnk68lMaQTVjdZjWQ.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>RCAs have played an integral part in our journey to becoming a SuperApp. Investigating, analysing, and documenting problems in production help us build better, more scalable systems, and tackle new problems in a mature manner without fear of retribution.</p><p>The days of weekly production issues are now a thing of the past.

GoFood ‚Äî Gojek‚Äôs food\ndelivery product ‚Äî lists 400,000+ merchants. You search for the outlet you want\nto order from, select the item and quantity, check out, and pay either via cash\nor Gojek‚Äôs digital wallet GoPay. Then, you sit back and watch the little Gojek\ndriver partner on the screen zoom their way to the restaurant, and bring you\nsome fried banana goodness. üòç\n\nSimple. Fast. Reliable.\n\n> Rewind a few years, and things didn‚Äôt look so good.\nFirst, some context\nWhen GoFood launched in 2015, expansion and adoption happened rapidly. The\norders started piling in, and we were struggling to keep up with demand.\nInitially, we‚Äôd simply list food merchants on our marketplace, send demand their\nway, and fulfil it through our fleet of driver partners.\n\nWe were building for our consumers and driver partners, but merchants were\nalways a key component of our ecosystem. If Gojek is an iceberg, the\nconsumer-facing Super App is the part above water. In this story, we‚Äôll dive\nbeneath the surface to explore another key component ‚Äî GoBiz, our merchant\nSuperApp.\n\n> But before GoBiz, there was GoResto.\nThe Merchant Problem\nIf we had ordered ourselves that pisang goreng in the early days of GoFood,\nthings would have worked very differently.\n\nYou see, merchants were onboarded by the GoFood team by uploading their menus to\nour systems. We‚Äôd look through these menus to find our fried banana of choice,\nand make an order, which would be relayed directly to a driver partner. This\npartner would then go to the restaurant and place the order (which is when the\nmerchant partner gets involved in the process).\n\nSo, while our bananas are fried, the driver partner would wait around, and when\nthe order is ready, pay in cash. The problem with this approach was that there\nwas no record of the transaction besides a booking on GoFood and a receipt\nhanded to the driver partner.\n\nThis was an inefficient system, for driver partners, and our customers.\n\n> Oh, and those merchants? Things weren‚Äôt rosy for them either.\nLet‚Äôs assume our pisang goreng place is a GoFood partner (meaning Gojek collects\ncommissions for the increased demand we send their way), and also part of a\nlarger chain. When we place the order, GoFood will assign it to one outlet of\nthe chain. However, our driver partner may decide to visit another outlet and\npick up the order from there.\n\nAt the end of the month, our restaurant partners would be invoiced for\ncommission that was due to us, based on sales as reported by the GoFood app.\nThis meant we were charging some merchants commission for sales their outlet may\nhave never made.\n\nWe spent a lot of time and resources addressing merchant complaints. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è\n\n> Then there was the matter of control.\nIf a merchant partner was not open for business on a particular day, wanted to\nupdate their menu, or indicate items as out of stock, they had to call Gojek\nCustomer Care. During this time, orders might still be coming in.\n\nLet‚Äôs just say we weren‚Äôt doing ourselves any favours. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è\n\nThere was a lot that needed fixing here, and it could only be done by\nintegrating merchants more deeply into our ecosystem. So that‚Äôs what we did.\n\nThe birth of GoResto\nTowards the end of 2016, a concept was developed for an app that would cater to\nGoFood merchant partners, and by early 2017 GoResto ‚Äî which is what we called it\nat the time ‚Äî was ready. You can read more about the product research process\nthat went into making GoResto here\n[https://blog.gojekengineering.com/whats-cooking-diving-into-kitchens-for-go-biz-e01051bfdc98]\n).\n\nWith GoResto, we addressed some of the problems outlined earlier.\n\n1. Electronic payments\nAll of Gojek‚Äôs driver partners had GoPay e-wallets associated with their\naccounts. With GoResto, we did the same for GoFood merchants. Transactions\nbetween driver and merchant partners would now be wallet-to-wallet, not cash.\nGojek would deduct any applicable commission immediately from the merchant\nwallet. This made the reconciliation process with merchants simpler.\n\n2. PIN exchange for restaurant verification\nTo eliminate fraud, driver partners would also need to share a PIN with the\nmerchant while picking up the order. This electronic handshake helped us verify\nthey were indeed picking up the right order from the right outlet.\n\nIt was a decent solution. If all went according to plan, we could breathe easy.\n\n> As you might have guessed, all did not go according to plan. üôá‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è\nIn the first iteration, the wallet creation process required collaboration with\nthe GoPay team, which was itself facing bandwidth constraints due to rapid\ngrowth (which we‚Äôll talk about a little later).\n\nAlso, the merchant onboarding to GoResto at this point was still a manual\nprocess. In our first month, we onboarded only 26 merchants. üò£\n\nWe needed a more scalable solution.\n\nHere‚Äôs a quick note on Gojek company culture. When the chips are down, it‚Äôs\nimportant for organisations to have core values to guide decision-making. One of\nour values happens to be:\n\nThis line is an affirmation to all stakeholders to take the best decision for a\nparticular situation based on available information. Such decisions are then\nrespected by everyone else.\n\nWe made two drastic decisions:\n\n 1. Merchant onboarding was completely frozen until we could build a platform to\n    automate the process.\n 2. Engineers from the Merchants team were embedded within GoPay, building\n    required capacities on GoPay systems while core GoPay engineers continued\n    work on scaling the platform.\n\n> In three months, as summer rolled around, GoResto was back.\nWe weren‚Äôt out of the woods yet though. All this was happening before Gojek had\ndeprecated its legacy codebase, Stan Marsh\n[https://blog.gojekengineering.com/thank-you-stan-marsh-29db553544bf], in favour\nof microservices, so system stability was not exactly excellent. As a result, we\nstill faced sync issues between GoFood and GoResto order management systems.\nThis, in turn, began to reflect on us publicly.\n\nOur app store rating at this point slid down to 3.2.\n\nMake It Work, Then Make It Better\nWe clearly had a long way to go to make GoResto the app our merchants deserved.\nThings were bad, but as they say ‚Äî sometimes the only way out is through.\n\nChallenge accepted. üí™\n\nFirst things first, we went about fixing the sync issues by building a second\nsystem to replace our unreliable version. Not only was this accomplished, but\nall onboarded merchants were migrated to the new system, with zero downtime. \nRead more about how this was done in this post\n[https://blog.gojekengineering.com/zero-downtime-traffic-migration-at-go-food-17ba413eb8c2]\n.\n\n> One small win.\nNow for the real problems, giving merchants the control they needed over how\nthey were represented on GoFood. The first self-serve feature we introduced to\nGoResto was allowing merchants to update their restaurant status in real time.\n\n> Another small win.\nWe had unlocked a critical component in product design ‚Äî empathy for the people\nyou‚Äôre building for. The question now was ‚Äî what can we do that will make life\neasier for our merchants?\n\nItem availability? Understood.\nMenu updation? Got it.\nPricing adjustments? Why not.\nAdd categories? Move items between categories? Update images?\n\n> Done, done‚Ä¶ and done. ‚úÖ\nOur systems were stable, early teething troubles were addressed, we were finally\nsolving the problems that needed solving.\n\nBuild It Right, And They Will Come\nAs GoResto grew in functionality, we began\n\n slowly earning back the goodwill of our merchant community. Soon, our app store\nrating began to reflect that.\n\nApp store ratings reflecting how customer goodwill can be earned back ‚úåÔ∏èWe\ndidn‚Äôt need to push GoResto to merchants anymore, it was adopted due to the ease\nof doing business it offered.\n\n> It was long overdue, but we had accomplished what we had set out to do. There\nwas finally a moment to sit back and enjoy the sunrise.\nOr so we thought.\n\nThe rest was short-lived. Southeast Asia was abuzz with activity. According to\nthis report\n[https://www.blog.google/documents/47/SEA_Internet_Economy_Report_2019.pdf], the\nvalue of the Internet economy in the region tripled in the years since 2015. The\nGross Merchandise Value (GMV) projection for 2025 is estimated to be $300\nbillion.\n\n> To put that in perspective ‚Äî in 2016, that projection was $100 billion.\nEven as GoResto was being built, there was another behemoth stirring under the\nrich waters of Indonesia‚Äôs digital payments landscape. GoPay, which had been\nrapidly growing in this favourable environment since its arrival in 2016, was\nnow being used by roughly three-quarters of digital payments users in Indonesia.\n\nBut we wanted more.\n\nIn 2018, GoPay introduced offline acceptance, bringing a whole new category of\nmerchant partners into our ecosystem.\n\n> Our existing solution wasn‚Äôt good enough anymore. It was time to evolve.\nKeep watching this space for the continued story charting GoResto‚Äôs evolution\ninto our full-fledged merchants platform ‚Äî GoBiz.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWant our updates beamed straight to your inbox?

Part\ntwo, which chronicles the journey of GOJEK‚Äôs Vietnam launch under the GO-VIET\nbrand, is here [http://bit.ly/2Rm2cSC].\n\nOn to part three then:\n\nPart 3/3 | Accomplishment\nThe atmosphere in Vietnam was celebratory. The GO-VIET launch had gone better\nthan anticipated, and our attempt to build robust, scalable systems looked to\nhave paid off. Ride and Send services were live in Vietnam, and engineers from\nGO-FOOD had already started working with Trifecta ‚Äî the team spearheading\nGOJEK‚Äôs international moves ‚Äî to launch our food product in Vietnam (FYI, it‚Äôs\nlive now).\n\nIn the months following Vietnam launch, Trifecta focused on setting up cadences\nwith different GOJEK product teams to streamline development and release cycles\nfor GO-VIET. Everything was up and running.\n\nNow, for the next stage ‚Äî Thailand.\n\nThe launch plan for Thailand was similar to what had been executed in Vietnam,\nincluding the products made available at launch (Ride and Send). In Thailand,\nthe brand would launch under the name GET.\n\n> We had proven it could be done. Now it was time to do it again. Easy, right?\nAs would soon become apparent, not really. This ride had a few last twists left.\n\nA Different Method\nWhile our Thailand operation would be similar to Vietnam on the infrastructure\nfront, to say we could just replicate the model as is would be an\noversimplification. For starters, Thailand‚Äôs currency, the Thai Baht, was not a\ndepreciated currency like Indonesian Rupiah or Vietnamese Dong.\n\n> Here‚Äôs some context:\n> 1 Indonesian Rupiah (IDR) = 0.0049 INR\n1 Vietnamese Dong (VND) = 0.0030 INR\n1 Thai Baht (THB) = 2.2 INR\nIncorporating this change would require some additional work from the team. On\ntop of this, the ride sharing market in Thailand is regulated by the Thai\ngovernment. Existing bike taxis (locally called WIN taxis) are licensed by the\ngovernment to serve as an effective mode of transportation. GOJEK‚Äôs entry into\nthe market provided an opportunity for WIN drivers to leverage the online\nplatform, while giving customers easy access to transportation\n\nThis arrangement required some work as well, as existing WIN drivers onboarded\nto GET would need to be prioritised initially while our own onboarding and\ntraining happened in parallel. All this meant that the launch model needed some\ntweaking, but nothing the team would need to sweat over too much.\n\nTalks were completed, local business teams were built, and a deadline was agreed\nupon with the Thai government to launch GET.\n\n> We should have known; rarely do companies building, scaling, and expanding at\nGOJEK‚Äôs pace experience such smooth sailing.\nThe Singapore Swing\nWorks, meet spanner.\n\nDue to the seismic shift in the ride-sharing business landscape of Southeast\nAsia in early 2018, GOJEK was also prepping for launch in Singapore on an\naccelerated timeline. Now was a good time to enter the lucrative market ‚Äî the\nmost developed in the region. GOJEK already enjoyed brand recognition thanks to\nthe amount of business travel between Jakarta and Singapore. By May 2018, a few\nmonths before GO-VIET went live, the launch teams for Singapore had already been\nformed.\n\n> Keeping with Singapore‚Äôs iconic lion motif, we named these teams Simba and\nMufasa. Stay tuned to this blog for their story, coming soon. ü¶Å\nAs 2018 drew on and all teams worked to hit their deadlines, the situation felt\na lot like the storms GOJEK weathered in its infancy. Multiple teams were\ndependent on the same resources as we lined up back-to-back country launches. To\ntop it all, holiday season ‚Äî one of the busiest times of the year ‚Äî was also\nkicking off.\n\nvia GIPHY [https://giphy.com/gifs/2oj7STwCx7wAM]\n\nWhile Trifecta had built much of the infrastructure framework required for\nlaunch, there were still dependencies on key GOJEK teams that were currently\nbuilding for Singapore. This threatened to slow down what was an otherwise\nstraightforward development timeline.\n\nThere was also that commitment of a launch date to the Thai Government to think\nabout. The stakes were not trivial.\n\n> The team could not afford to lose more time. Time for desperate measures.\nWith just about a month left for launch, the team members ‚Äî distributed across\nmultiple locations ‚Äî convened at the GOJEK Bangalore office. All the\ndocumentation done during the pre-Vietnam launch phase meant that everyone had a\nfair idea of what needed to be done. Launching Singapore and Thailand without\ndelay was critical to business, and we could not afford delays.\n\nWith this in mind, tough decisions were made. The Trifecta team decided to roll\nup their sleeves and take full ownership of Thailand, freeing up the GOJEK\nTransport team to dedicate more resources to Singapore. Trifecta team members\nflew in to Thailand to coordinate the work there, and the project slowly picked\nup steam once again. All the legwork done at the beginning of this exercise had\ncome to fruition.\n\nThe team now had enough context about GOJEK services, and as the days to launch\nticked away, so did the items on the pre-launch checklist.\n\nIt took some doing, with the environment and frameworks built and stabilised\nwhile activities like driver onboarding and early alpha testing happened in\nparallel.\n\n> The going was not easy, but this wasn‚Äôt our first rodeo.\nTrifecta Tech Lead Sumit Gupta, who was around in early 2016 during GOJEK‚Äôs\nfrantic growth as well, mentions how everyone was more confident this time\naround. Thanks to to the team deciding to build a fast and scalable\ncontainer-based architecture for Vietnam and Thailand, they were sure the system\nwould function reliably. üí™\n\nThe home stretch\nDespite the apprehensions, Trifecta managed to pull through.

If you haven‚Äôt\nread part one, get up to speed here.\n\nPart 2/3 | Initiation\nWhen we left Trifecta ‚Äî the team responsible for charting GOJEK‚Äôs international\nexpansion ‚Äî in the last part of this series, the team was working on setting up\na new environment for launch in Vietnam. But now, there were new problems to\ntackle.\n\nProblem #1: Configuration drift\n\nUntil this point, GOJEK had always operated within Indonesia, but Trifecta was\nnow in unmapped territory, building a completely new environment for GOJEK‚Äôs\nservices in Vietnam. The services now needed to be configured separately across\ngeographies, and there was no central location to manage these configurations\neffectively. This meant there was a chance of configuration inconsistencies\ncreeping in over time (hence the term ‚Äòdrift‚Äô).\n\nProblem #2: Deployment drift\n\nEven if the team hacked a solution for the first problem, deploying the code\nwould pose another one. It was imperative that the same version of code run on\nall the environments (the existing one in Indonesia, the one being built for\nVietnam, and any future ones). Failing this, supporting services across\ncountries would be a nightmare.\n\n> That wasn‚Äôt the kind of risk a startup that expounds lean engineering could\nafford to take.\nProblem #3: A logging and monitoring solution for the Kubernetes cluster.\n\nAs this was the first time containers were being used by GOJEK, a new logging\nsolution would be required for future debugging needs.\n\nMuch time had been lost already, it was time to bring in the big guns.\n\nEven as the team dodged obstacles and took detours, making the best use of\navailable resources, Project Managers Sourabh Gupta and Sanchit Juneja had been\ncommunicating with other teams for backup. They had found some ad-hoc support,\nbut to see this journey through would need more seasoned soldiers.\n\nFinally, this effort came to fruition.\n\nTrifecta V2.0\nAfter some negotiation, the team got the go-ahead for Sumit Gupta, another GOJEK\nveteran, to make the transition from GOJEK‚Äôs Atlas team to join Trifecta full\ntime. Sumit had led GOJEK‚Äôs scaling efforts back in 2015, when the company was\nin constant firefighting mode, and knew a thing or two about dealing with the\nkind of situation the team was in.

If you haven‚Äôt read part one, get up to speed here.</p><h1 id=\"part-2-3-initiation\">Part 2/3 | Initiation</h1><p>When we left Trifecta ‚Äî the team responsible for charting GOJEK‚Äôs international expansion ‚Äî in the last part of this series, the team was working on setting up a new environment for launch in Vietnam. But now, there were new problems to tackle.</p><p><strong><strong>Problem #1: Configuration drift</strong></strong></p><p>Until this point, GOJEK had always operated within Indonesia, but Trifecta was now in unmapped territory, building a completely new environment for GOJEK‚Äôs services in Vietnam. The services now needed to be configured separately across geographies, and there was no central location to manage these configurations effectively. This meant there was a chance of configuration inconsistencies creeping in over time (hence the term ‚Äòdrift‚Äô).</p><p><strong><strong>Problem #2: Deployment drift</strong></strong></p><p>Even if the team hacked a solution for the first problem, deploying the code would pose another one. It was imperative that the same version of code run on all the environments (the existing one in Indonesia, the one being built for Vietnam, and any future ones). Failing this, supporting services across countries would be a nightmare.</p><blockquote><em><em>That wasn‚Äôt the kind of risk a startup that expounds lean engineering could afford to take.</em></em></blockquote><p><strong><strong>Problem #3: A logging and monitoring solution for the Kubernetes cluster.</strong></strong></p><p>As this was the first time containers were being used by GOJEK, a new logging solution would be required for future debugging needs.</p><p><em><em>Much time had been lost already, it was time to bring in the big guns.</em></em></p><p>Even as the team dodged obstacles and took detours, making the best use of available resources, Project Managers Sourabh Gupta and Sanchit Juneja had been communicating with other teams for backup. They had found some ad-hoc support, but to see this journey through would need more seasoned soldiers.</p><p>Finally, this effort came to fruition.</p><h1 id=\"trifecta-v2-0\">Trifecta V2.0</h1><p>After some negotiation, the team got the go-ahead for Sumit Gupta, another GOJEK veteran, to make the transition from GOJEK‚Äôs Atlas team to join Trifecta full time. Sumit had led GOJEK‚Äôs scaling efforts back in 2015, when the company was in constant firefighting mode, and knew a thing or two about dealing with the kind of situation the team was in. He would now assume the role of Trifecta‚Äôs Tech Lead.</p><p>With a renewed sense of purpose, the team looked back at the roadmap and reassessed priorities.

Let‚Äôs take music as an example. It\nhelps to know the theory and to understand the mechanics of your instrument. It\nalso helps to have talent. Having a good partner to watch your back doesn‚Äôt hurt\neither. But there‚Äôs more to it.\n\nWhy are The Beatles [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles], who formed in\nLiverpool in 1960, considered one of the greatest bands in history\n[https://www.quora.com/Why-are-The-Beatles-the-greatest-band-in-history/answer/Giliana-P-Garc%C3%ADa-Acevedo-1]\n? Why doesn‚Äôt everyone else achieve the same level of success?\n\n> The difference between master and beginner is the amount of practice.\nThe Beatles applied the fundamentals they learned over and over again, using\nfeedback to get better every time. All told, they performed for 270 nights in\njust over a year-and-a-half. By the time they had their first taste of success\nin 1964, they had performed live an estimated 1,200 times. Most bands today\ndon‚Äôt perform that much in their entire career.\n\nThe 10,000 Hours rule\nIn the early 1990s, psychologist K. Anders Ericsson and two of his colleagues at\nBerlin‚Äôs elite Academy of Music conducted a study\n[http://projects.ict.usc.edu/itw/gel/EricssonDeliberatePracticePR93.PDF]. With\nthe help of the Academy, they interviewed twelve expert pianists (8 men and 4\nwomen) and 12 amateurs (7 men and 5 women).\n\nThe amateurs never practiced more than about three hours a week over the course\nof their childhood, and by the age of twenty, they had totaled two thousand\nhours of practice. The experts, on the other hand, steadily increased their\npractice time every year, until by the age of twenty, they had reached ten\nthousand hours.\n\n> ‚ÄúTo become a chess grandmaster also seems to take about ten years. (Only the\nlegendary Bobby Fisher got to that elite level in less than that amount of time:\nit took him nine years.) And what‚Äôs ten years? Well, it‚Äôs roughly how long it\ntakes to put in ten thousand hours of hard practice. Ten thousand hours is the\nmagic number of greatness.‚Äù\n> Malcolm Gladwell, in his book ‚ÄúOutliers: The Story of Success\n[http://amzn.to/wgo1hw]‚Äù\nThe interesting thing about that number, of course, is that ten thousand hours\nis an enormous amount of time. It‚Äôs all but impossible to reach that number all\nby yourself by the time you‚Äôre a young adult. This would require encouraging\nparents and some measure of wealth, which would avoid the need to hold down\nadditional jobs that would eat into valuable practice time.\n\nWhat Happens in the Software Industry\nIn the software industry, we take developers trained in theory and throw them\nstraight into the deep-end, working on a project with no real precedent to draw\nfrom. It‚Äôs like taking a group of kids to fight against the big gang in the\ntown. But that is not an issue because, in software engineering, we do our\npracticing on the job, and that‚Äôs why we make mistakes on the job. But at the\nend of the day, we want to be great while still managing the objectives. For\nthat purpose, we need to find ways of splitting the practice from the\nprofession. A practice method that is effective and without taking up too much\ntime.\n\n> This is where CodeKata comes in.\nThe CodeKata\nKata [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kata] is an exercise in Karate to execute a\nspecified series of a variety of moves, with stepping and turning, while\nattempting to maintain perfect form. It teaches the student about proper form\nand position to helped them visualize different scenarios for each motion and\ntechnique. Traditionally, kata is taught in stages. Previously learned kata are\nrepeated to show better technique or power as a student acquires knowledge and\nexperience. It is common for students to repeat every kata they have learned but\nat an improved level of quality.\n\nSandy Vs. SpongebobCodeKata is an attempt to bring this element of practice to software\ndevelopment. The intent behind CodeKata is similar to Karate Kata. Each is a\nshort exercise. It repeated multiple times, adding little improvements in each\ncycle. Some involve programming and can be coded in many different ways. Some\ninvolve thinking about the issues behind programming and design. These are\nunlikely to have a single correct answer.\n\n> Remember that the point of the kata is not arriving at the correct answer. The\npoint is the stuff you learn along the way. The goal is the practice, not the\nsolution.\nHow Is This Accomplished at Gojek?\nAt Gojek, there‚Äôs a program for employees called Engineering Bootcamp\n[https://blog.gojekengineering.com/what-is-the-go-jek-engineering-bootcamp-de7778836da9]\n. Basically, it is weeks of intense hands-on learning designed to unlearn and\nequip skills needed to be a world-class engineer.\n\nCore Engineering BootcampAt Bootcamp, the way coaches taught us (participants)\nis similar to CodeKata. We have a code drill session in the afternoon to solve\none problem by using Java. After the class ends, we solve the same problem again\nas homework in the evening using Ruby. There are many things we did in our code\ndrill session, that really helped us develop in CodeKata. Those are:\n\n1. Set Rules\nWe have rules called Non-Negotiable Etiquette. If you violate one of the rules,\nyou have to rm -rf your code and start it again from scratch. What is rm -rf? It\nis a basic command on Unix system to remove files or directories from the\nmachine forever.\n\nNon Negotiable Etiquette\nIf you violate one, rm -rf! never love your code </3\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n 1.  Indentation and spacing between code constructs (classes/methods/specs)\n     must be consistent.\n 2.  Use only spaces (no tabs) for indentation.\n 3.  Newlines at end of file.\n 4.  Follow accepted naming conventions for your language/framework.\n 5.  Follow accepted naming file and Directory structure for your\n     language/framework.\n 6.  Use namespaces.\n 7.  No comments/Unused Code/Unused file/Unused folder must ever be checked in.\n 8.  Runtime environment should be consistent with IDE environment‚Ää-‚Ää i.e there\n     should be no difference in running a build or a spec from your IDE and from\n     the command line.\n 9.  Use .gitignore.\n 10. Ensure there is a README.md that includes problem description, dev\n     environment setup, build instructions, and run instructions.\n 11. Test Driven Development (this should show in clear pattern in the commit\n     log‚Ää-‚Ääone spec, one code change per commit)\n\nCan you imagine the feeling when code that we wrote with blood and tears needs\nto be deleted for one small mistake? Is that acceptable?\n\n> Yes, you must not love your code.\nThat small mistake is not tolerable in production and even development. It could\ncause bugs, errors or other things that may become a bottleneck. But of course,\nwe don‚Äôt rm -rf in work üòÇ. It‚Äôs just a practice so that we don‚Äôt get overly\nattached to the code, remain careful about mistakes, and most importantly ‚Äî\nmaintain quality.\n\n2. Practise Pair Programming\nAs the name implies, pair programming is where two developers work on one\nmachine. We only have a keyboard and a mouse for each pair. One developer acts\nas the driver who codes while the other serves as the observer who checks the\ncode being written, proofreads and spell-checks, and also figures out where to\ngo next. These roles can be switched at any time: the driver will then become\nthe observer and vice versa.\n\nPair Programming greatly helps us in CodeKata, because:\n\n * It‚Äôs harder to procrastinate. Working as a team means you can‚Äôt stop and\n   check your email, Slack, Facebook or WhatsApp every few minutes.\n * When someone shares a problem you are going through, you feel less defeated\n   and more positive about trying again.\n * Increases software quality without impacting much on time to deliver. It will\n   cost only 15% of the development time according to this study\n   [https://www.economist.com/technology-quarterly/2001/09/20/agility-counts].\n   But with increased quality comes big savings later in the project.\n\n3. Have a Short Cycle\nThe point of CodeKata is to get experience from practice. In order to achieve\nthat, we solve the same problem multiple times. We try different approaches and\nsolutions to experience each advantage and disadvantage. While we work on it, we\nalso try to add little improvements for every cycle. But sometimes, we can also\ntreat the cycle as an iteration of solving the problem.\n\nBecause CodeKata is a practicing method and not project development. It‚Äôs not\nsupposed to be worked on for the long run. For that reason, we only have 20‚Äì30\nmins for every cycle (sometimes even shorter).\n\nAfter the Mini Retro, we showcase our code to other participants in the class.\nWhy do we need to do it? Even though the whole class is working on the same\nproblem, we may interpret it differently and have hundreds of possible different\nsolutions. Doing a showcase will tell others about progress and approaches. It\nwill trigger a discussion and synchronize the context for everyone. At the end\nof the day, we will converge at the current best solution.\n\n> It‚Äôs similar to Agile Development. You deliver something to the customer as soon\nas possible to get feedback faster.\nA Few Final Thoughts\nMy tips for CodeKata are:\n\n * Find a place and time where you won‚Äôt be interrupted.\n * Focus on the essential elements of the Kata.\n * Remember to look for feedback for every major decision\n * If it helps, keep a journal of your progress\n * Have discussion groups with other developers, but try to have completed the\n   kata first\n\nCore Engineering BootcampThank you for reading this blog!

Why doesn‚Äôt everyone else achieve the same level of success?</p><blockquote>The difference between master and beginner is the amount of practice.</blockquote><p>The Beatles applied the fundamentals they learned over and over again, using feedback to get better every time. All told, they performed for 270 nights in just over a year-and-a-half. By the time they had their first taste of success in 1964, they had performed live an estimated 1,200 times. Most bands today don‚Äôt perform that much in their entire career.</p><h3 id=\"the-10-000-hours-rule\">The 10,000 Hours rule</h3><p>In the early 1990s, psychologist K. Anders Ericsson and two of his colleagues at Berlin‚Äôs elite Academy of Music conducted a <a href=\"http://projects.ict.usc.edu/itw/gel/EricssonDeliberatePracticePR93.PDF\" rel=\"noopener\">study</a>. With the help of the Academy, they interviewed twelve expert pianists (8 men and 4 women) and 12 amateurs (7 men and 5 women).</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/912/1*XesRz3d5FMCzIOfm7Yk3hA.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>The amateurs never practiced more than about three hours a week over the course of their childhood, and by the age of twenty, they had totaled two thousand hours of practice. The experts, on the other hand, steadily increased their practice time every year, until by the age of twenty, they had reached ten thousand hours.</p><blockquote><em><em>‚ÄúTo become a chess grandmaster also seems to take about ten years. (Only the legendary Bobby Fisher got to that elite level in less than that amount of time: it took him nine years.) And what‚Äôs ten years? Well, it‚Äôs roughly how long it takes to put in ten thousand hours of hard practice. <strong><strong>Ten thousand hours</strong></strong> is the magic number of greatness.‚Äù</em></em></blockquote><blockquote><em><em>Malcolm Gladwell, in his book ‚Äú<a href=\"http://amzn.to/wgo1hw\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Outliers: The Story of Success</em></a><em>‚Äù</em></em></em></blockquote><p>The interesting thing about that number, of course, is that ten thousand hours is an enormous amount of time. It‚Äôs all but impossible to reach that number all by yourself by the time you‚Äôre a young adult. This would require encouraging parents and some measure of wealth, which would avoid the need to hold down additional jobs that would eat into valuable practice time.</p><h3 id=\"what-happens-in-the-software-industry\">What Happens in the Software Industry</h3><p>In the software industry, we take developers trained in theory and throw them straight into the deep-end, working on a project with no real precedent to draw from. It‚Äôs like taking a group of kids to fight against the big gang in the town. But that is not an issue because, in software engineering, we do our practicing on the job, and that‚Äôs why we make mistakes on the job. But at the end of the day, we want to be great while still managing the objectives. For that purpose, we need to find ways of splitting the practice from the profession. A practice method that is effective and without taking up too much time.</p><blockquote><em><em>This is where CodeKata comes in.</em></em></blockquote><h3 id=\"the-codekata\">The CodeKata</h3><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kata\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong><strong>Kata</strong></strong></a> is an exercise in Karate to execute a specified series of a variety of moves, with stepping and turning, while attempting to maintain perfect form. It teaches the student about proper form and position to helped them visualize different scenarios for each motion and technique. Traditionally, kata is taught in stages. Previously learned kata are repeated to show better technique or power as a student acquires knowledge and experience. It is common for students to repeat every kata they have learned but at an improved level of quality.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/670/1*icPku4JdhwTHMvyV7uPLZw.gif\" class=\"kg-image\"><figcaption>Sandy Vs. Spongebob</figcaption></figure><p><strong><strong>CodeKata</strong></strong> is an attempt to bring this element of practice to software development. The intent behind CodeKata is similar to Karate Kata. Each is a short exercise. It repeated multiple times, adding little improvements in each cycle. Some involve programming and can be coded in many different ways. Some involve thinking about the issues behind programming and design. These are unlikely to have a single correct answer.</p><blockquote>Remember that the point of the kata is not arriving at the correct answer. The point is the stuff you learn along the way. The goal is the practice, not the solution.</blockquote><h3 id=\"how-is-this-accomplished-at-gojek\">How Is This Accomplished at Gojek?</h3><p>At Gojek, there‚Äôs a program for employees called <a href=\"https://blog.gojekengineering.com/what-is-the-go-jek-engineering-bootcamp-de7778836da9\" rel=\"noopener\">Engineering Bootcamp</a>. Basically, it is weeks of intense hands-on learning designed to unlearn and equip skills needed to be a world-class engineer.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/3840/1*uo6NJ-s_43bjcY2V_JDSPQ.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\"><figcaption>Core Engineering Bootcamp</figcaption></figure><p>At Bootcamp, the way coaches taught us (participants) is similar to CodeKata. We have a code drill session in the afternoon to solve one problem by using Java. After the class ends, we solve the same problem again as homework in the evening using Ruby. There are many things we did in our code drill session, that really helped us develop in CodeKata. Those are:</p><h3 id=\"1-set-rules\">1. Set Rules</h3><p>We have rules called <strong><strong>Non-Negotiable Etiquette</strong></strong>. If you violate one of the rules, you have to <em><em>rm -rf</em></em> your code and start it again from scratch. What is <em><em>rm -rf</em></em>? It is a basic command on Unix system to remove files or directories from the machine forever.</p><h3 id=\"non-negotiable-etiquette\">Non Negotiable Etiquette</h3><p>If you violate one, rm -rf! never love your code &lt;/3</p><hr><ol><li>Indentation and spacing between code constructs (classes/methods/specs) must be consistent.</li><li>Use only spaces (no tabs) for indentation.</li><li>Newlines at end of file.</li><li>Follow accepted naming conventions for your language/framework.</li><li>Follow accepted naming file and Directory structure for your language/framework.</li><li>Use namespaces.</li><li>No comments/Unused Code/Unused file/Unused folder must ever be checked in.</li><li>Runtime environment should be consistent with IDE environment‚Ää-‚Ää i.e there should be no difference in running a build or a spec from your IDE and from the command line.</li><li>Use .gitignore.</li><li>Ensure there is a README.md that includes problem description, dev environment setup, build instructions, and run instructions.</li><li>Test Driven Development (this should show in clear pattern in the commit log‚Ää-‚Ääone spec, one code change per commit)</li></ol><p>Can you imagine the feeling when code that we wrote with blood and tears needs to be deleted for one small mistake? Is that acceptable?</p><blockquote>Yes, you must not love your code.</blockquote><p>That small mistake is not tolerable in production and even development. It could cause bugs, errors or other things that may become a bottleneck. But of course, we don‚Äôt <em><em>rm -rf</em></em> in work üòÇ. It‚Äôs just a practice so that we don‚Äôt get overly attached to the code, remain careful about mistakes, and most importantly ‚Äî maintain quality.</p><h3 id=\"2-practise-pair-programming\">2. Practise Pair Programming</h3><p>As the name implies, pair programming is where two developers work on one machine. We only have a keyboard and a mouse for each pair. One developer acts as the driver who codes while the other serves as the observer who checks the code being written, proofreads and spell-checks, and also figures out where to go next. These roles can be switched at any time: the driver will then become the observer and vice versa.</p><p>Pair Programming greatly helps us in CodeKata, because:</p><ul><li>It‚Äôs harder to procrastinate. Working as a team means you can‚Äôt stop and check your email, Slack, Facebook or WhatsApp every few minutes.</li><li>When someone shares a problem you are going through, you feel less defeated and more positive about trying again.</li><li>Increases software quality without impacting much on time to deliver. It will cost only 15% of the development time according to this <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/technology-quarterly/2001/09/20/agility-counts\" rel=\"noopener\">study</a>. But with increased quality comes big savings later in the project.</li></ul><h3 id=\"3-have-a-short-cycle\">3. Have a Short Cycle</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/982/1*14PeUCfZheM8mK7xm6FL8w.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>The point of CodeKata is to get experience from practice. In order to achieve that, we solve the same problem multiple times. We try different approaches and solutions to experience each advantage and disadvantage. While we work on it, we also try to add little improvements for every cycle. But sometimes, we can also treat the cycle as an iteration of solving the problem.</p><p>Because CodeKata is a practicing method and not project development. It‚Äôs not supposed to be worked on for the long run. For that reason, we only have 20‚Äì30 mins for every cycle (sometimes even shorter).</p><p>After the Mini Retro, we showcase our code to other participants in the class. Why do we need to do it? Even though the whole class is working on the same problem, we may interpret it differently and have hundreds of possible different solutions. Doing a showcase will tell others about progress and approaches. It will trigger a discussion and synchronize the context for everyone. At the end of the day, we will converge at the current best solution.</p><blockquote>It‚Äôs similar to Agile Development. You deliver something to the customer as soon as possible to get feedback faster.</blockquote><h3 id=\"a-few-final-thoughts\">A Few Final Thoughts</h3><p>My tips for CodeKata are:</p><ul><li>Find a place and time where you won‚Äôt be interrupted.</li><li>Focus on the essential elements of the Kata.</li><li>Remember to look for feedback for every major decision</li><li>If it helps, keep a journal of your progress</li><li>Have discussion groups with other developers, but try to have completed the kata first</li></ul><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/4240/1*53r0Npq_Thb0R0saRF08Rg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\"><figcaption>Core Engineering Bootcamp</figcaption></figure><p>Thank you for reading this blog!

Having that kind of impact across Southeast Asia and getting to work with\nextremely talented engineers really appealed to me, and I felt I could make a\ngood contribution.\n\nBut before I could make my move, I had to make sure I knew what I was getting\ninto. Was my desire to move rising out of discontent, or something that could be\neasily resolved? If I could even get into EPD, what would I be working on?\n\nWould I even enjoy my new position, or find myself pining for something new\nagain? Would all my efforts have been for naught?\n\nThis post is for anyone in a similar situation, and lists things to consider\nbefore taking the leap:\n\nDiscern your motivation\nTake time to introspect, and pick apart your motivations. What‚Äôs driving your\ndecision to move? Are you unsatisfied with your current job? Do you have issues\nwith your role, your team, your boss? Are you looking for a new adventure in a\nbrand new area? Are you ready to put in time outside of work to train yourself\nfor the new position?\n\nAsking yourself these pointed questions can help define what you really yearn\nfor, and outline how to get there. Which brings us to the next point.\n\nFind your niche\nCheck your company‚Äôs job listings online to understand what they‚Äôre looking for.\nRead them thoroughly to understand the skills you need before applying. Are\nthere positions available for entry-level engineers? If so, prioritise these\npositions, as they require less programming experience, and provide a\nspringboard for you to supercharge your growth as an engineer.\n\nTalk to engineers\nThe biggest advantage of moving internally is you already have access to many of\nyour (potentially) future peers. Have a casual conversation with your company‚Äôs\ndevelopers to understand the expectations of the job. Use this as an opportunity\nto go beyond the job description ‚Äî to really understand what it‚Äôs like working\nin your desired position. What technologies do they use on a day-to-day basis?\nDo they have to work odd hours? What‚Äôs the career path like? We don‚Äôt bite!

I knew Gojek had (and still has) high\nexpectations for anyone who wants to join the division.\n\nThe comforting factor was that Gojek is incredibly open to anybody who can prove\nthemselves. Many successful engineers in Gojek made jumps like the one I wanted\nto make, and some of them had no formal training in computer science or software\ndevelopment! If anything, that was proof that anybody who strove and acted had a\nshot at success.\n\nNow that you‚Äôve made your choice: here are some tips to help propel you forward\nin tech as a beginner:\n\nUpgrade your skills:\nNow that you know what skills your desired position requires on a daily basis,\nit‚Äôs time to put in the hours training up. There are countless guides on the\nInternet for every technology under the Sun, so pick one and follow it through!\nDon‚Äôt forget to do the exercises included, and work on pet projects to really\nhone in on what you‚Äôve just learned. Remember: practice makes perfect!\n\nJoin company training programs:\nAside from taking up personal projects, look around to see if your company has\nset up training and development programs. These would be directly aligned with\nwhat your company is looking for in engineers, and offer a framework for you to\ngrow with. In Gojek, we‚Äôre lucky to have two major programs:\n\n * The Gojek Tech Bootcamp. Designed for fresh grads taking on an entry-level\n   position in EPD across all divisions, the Bootcamp helps accelerate the\n   growth of would-be engineers through full immersion ‚Äî the philosophy, the\n   practices, the works.\n * The GoAcademy program. Intended for anyone in the company looking for a\n   structured way to grow in areas from data analysis and visualisation to\n   personal wellness, GoAcademy sets up tutorials led by experienced engineers,\n   fully contextualised to meet the needs of GoTroops from different teams and\n   fields.\n\nContribute to open-source:\nIf you don‚Äôt have enough experience to meet the requirements of your desired\nposition, fret not! Look into contributing to open-source projects to level up.\nContributing to open source works very much like contributing to a product team.\nYou‚Äôll be working on real bugs reported by users, or even proposing your own\nfeatures to implement. The biggest open-source projects have vibrant communities\nthat are very welcoming of newcomers ‚Äî some even have bugs specifically marked\nfor solving by new developers!\n\nThe benefits of working on open-source only increases if you can find and\ncontribute to projects launched by your own company.

You‚Äôll\nget to showcase your collaboration and problem-solving skills to your future\nfellow engineers ‚Äî all before sending in an application!\n\nBonus point: should you contribute using GitHub, GitLab, or any public tool,\nyou‚Äôll have a portfolio ready to link to and show around!\n\nTalk to tech leads and product managers:\nMuch like talking to engineers, speaking with tech leads and product managers\nwill give you a sense of what the job would be like, but on a higher level. Use\nthis opportunity to ask about the current state of the team, the obstacles\nthey‚Äôre facing, and future of the product. Position yourself in their eyes as\nsomeone who is ready to learn and contribute ‚Äî you‚Äôll be making your mark before\nyou even have a formal interview!\n\nAs for me, I‚Äôm now a Product Engineer, part of Gojek‚Äôs Operations Platform,\nworking on our internal service product and helping maintain our customer\nsupport platform. It‚Äôs been almost a year since I made the decision to switch\nroles, and I‚Äôm glad to say that, even though it took several months to find a\nrole that met my desires and the needs of the company, I‚Äôve found a place where\nI can grow and contribute to Gojek.\n\nWhile my new world is far removed from the spreadsheets and queries of my old\none, the skills I honed back then remain incredibly relevant and essential to my\nnew duties. The eye for numbers and detail I developed has been crucial for\nspotting points of improvement in development. The communication skills I gained\nfrom presenting to higher-ups has helped me describe my ideas clearly. My time\nas a business analyst was not a waste in the least bit ‚Äî in fact, it helped me\ntowards faster growth and success in my new role.\n\nIf you‚Äôre in a similar position and contemplating changing roles, I hope this\narticle has helped in the decision process. ?\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWant our updates to appear in your inbox?

As the Summer\nPlacements semester got going in full swing, I decided to pursue an internship\nin the Product Management domain.\n\nWhen someone asked me: ‚ÄúWhich is your dream company?‚Äù, I was not sure. I\nrealised that although there were renowned names coming on campus, for some\nreason, I wanted something more exciting.\n\nAfter days of pondering, I decided to apply off campus. A list was compiled, and\nthe options trickled down to three: Google, LinkedIn and Gojek! Thankfully,\nGojek had a PM internship opening. I applied, interviews went well and I was\nextended an offer at the Bangalore office.\n\nChapter 1: Documentation\n1st April 2019\n\nI reached the office full of enthusiasm, ready to make a mark of my own. The\nwhole day went in different formalities and it was almost evening when I got to\nmeet my team. To my surprise, by the end of the day, I was part of all relevant\ncommunication channels, team drives and had clarity on what I would work on for\nthe next four weeks.\n\nI just loved the agility shown by my manager to enable me to embark on my\njourney. In the process, I also realised why my undergrad friends working at\nGojek used to say that if you love speed, this is the place to be.\n\nThe next few days were spent understanding the product, people, and culture. I\nwas surprised by the volume and quality of the documentation done at the\ncompany. For a company which prides itself in being one of the fastest growing\nstartups in the world, this kind of emphasis on documentation was something\nunheard of. And because of these hundreds of beautifully crafted documents, by\nthe end of the first week itself, I was participating in their BAU (Business As\nUsual) meetings. (How many interns can claim this? üòú)\n\nChapter 2: Reading\n15th April 2019\n\nI was no longer a newbie in the company. I was having 1:1s with different\nstakeholders, attending IPMs (Internal Planning Meetings), BAU meetings and\nworking tirelessly on my dedicated projects.\n\nDuring the course of these all, one day I reached out to my mentor for\nsuggestions on how to prioritise among different features. This was his\nresponse:\n\n> ‚ÄúRead Abhishek, Read. What differentiates a good Product Manager from an average\none is his/her willingness to learn, and reading is the first and most important\nstep there.‚Äù\nHe gave me different links to read, (37 to be precise) which ranged from Product\nPrioritization, Product Design, Product Critique, Design Heuristics and even the\nPsychology involved in product success. As I pored through them, I realised\nProduct Management is not as random as it seems from outside. In fact, it is a\nfine cocktail of art and science mixed in just the right proportion.\n\nChapter 3: Inclusion\n23rd April 2019\n\nBy this point, I had completed my first project, got positive feedback, and was\nabout to finish the second. In the meantime, being a part of so many BAU\nmeetings had boosted my confidence and now I was chipping in with suggestions.\n\nDuring one such meetings, I raised a point in contradiction to what the other\nteam was saying. I tried to explain my point of view but we were not able to\ncome to an agreement. When I came out, I realised that I should have dealt with\nthe situation differently. I went to my mentor and explained as much.\n\n> To this, he said: ‚ÄúSometimes it‚Äôs not only about how you or your team is looking\nat things. You also have to look at what is the value proposition of other teams\ninvolved‚Äù\nThis was the second important lesson which I learnt: being a PM your job is to\nfirst bring everyone at the table to a common ground before pushing any agenda. \nWhether it is inter-team or intra-team, to get the job done, you have to bring\npeople to your side by understanding what they want and why they want it.\n\nChapter 4: Relevance\n30th April 2019\n\nI had just finished my second project when I met a senior engineer while passing\nthrough the pantry area. He asked how it‚Äôs going and what I was working on. I,\nwith full excitement, told him many ideas I came up with.\n\nAnd then he said: ‚ÄúMan, it doesn‚Äôt matter how cool the ideas are or how great\nthey sound. Judge them on their relevance. Are they correctly solving the\nproblem intended? Are they adding value to the lives of relevant stakeholders?‚Äù\nAnd then he gave me a set of 10 similar questions and said that if after\nanswering these 10 questions, you still believe you should implement the idea, \nthen it matters.\n\nChapter 5: Impact\n7th May 2019\n\nI had started understanding the nitty-gritty of product management and was\nraring to pick a more challenging project. And then I got this mail from my\nmanager:\n\nReally??? After such nice product & strategy based projects, this is what you\nwant me to do!!\n\n> But again, that was my inexperience talking.\nDuring the course of the next week, I learnt one more valuable lesson: ‚ÄúLook at\nthe impact of your work, not how cool it sounds. Being a PM, the world is your\ndomain and processes are as important as the product itself. If you want your\nproduct to succeed, you need to oil the whole machinery.‚Äù\n\nRecently, I came to know that a senior PM found the document to be super good\nand now it is being used across the substreams to onboard new hires. (I‚Äôm\nallowed one humblebrag right? üòÖ)\n\nChapter 6: Communication\n21st May 2019\n\nThe changing weather of Bangalore had hit me hard and I had to take a leave\nowing to ill health. I sent a message each to my manager and mentor regarding\nthe same. My mentor replied asking me to inform the whole team, which I missed\nand read quite late. When I did, I figured I am an intern anyway, and don‚Äôt have\nany current projects with the team. Even if I don‚Äôt send the mail to them, it\ndoesn‚Äôt matter much.\n\nWhen I met my mentor the next day, he asked why I didn‚Äôt send the mail, and I\nexplained why. He said: ‚ÄúAbhishek, it doesn‚Äôt matter whether you have a current\nproject with the team or not. Being a PM, one of the most important skills is\nbeing very clear in communication. There might be situations where you wouldn‚Äôt\neven know and people would be waiting for you. Not only in this case, but in\nevery everything you do, a PM needs to be a clear and careful communicator.‚Äù\n\nChapter 7: Ownership\n24th May 2019\n\nMy internship was nearing it‚Äôs end, and I reached out to my mentor for some\nsuggestions on the last project I was working on. During our conversation, he\nasked if my previous one had gone live in production. I said no, but clarified\nthat my part is done and it is stuck on other collaborating teams.\n\nThat‚Äôs when I realised I had one last lesson left to learn:\n\n> ‚ÄúBeing a PM it‚Äôs your job to get it from conception to production. If there are\nblockers, you have to proactively reach out to remove them. Being a PM is a\ntricky job, once you have dirtied your hand, the onus comes on you to get it to\ncompletion.‚Äù\n> ‚ÄúOnce you have picked up something ‚Äî It‚Äôs All Yours.‚Äù\nEpilogue\nToday, when I look back, my internship at Gojek was a short, but sweet journey\nwhich taught me many lessons. As I go back for my second year at IIMA, I am much\nmore confident when it comes to Product Management.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSpecial thanks to my manager Vikrama Dhiman, my mentor Manas J Saloi, Shobhit\nSrivastava, and all the members of the Transport team who were always ready to\nhelp me during the course of my journey.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWant more updates on how we build scalable systems for Southeast Asia‚Äôs\n#SuperApp?

While that might seem outlandish, if\nyou‚Äôre a developer, you might just get what I mean. Think about it carefully; it\ncan repeat mundane tasks, making people more productive. It can solve complex\nproblems, so devs can focus on pressing tasks.\n\nHowever, it can also complicate culture; like introducing a biometric system to\ntrack employee attendance, and have software track sick leaves.\n\n> In essence, an organisation‚Äôs tech stack will reflect the health of the company.\nIf you‚Äôre focused on writing beautiful code, it‚Äôs likely that employees are\ndisciplined, organised, and believe in the company‚Äôs values. It‚Äôs really not\nthat far-fetched a correlation.\n\nThis is a similar story; the story of Kafka ‚Äî an open source tool that solved\nculture for us. Will try and simplify this for a broad audience, so devs, please\nbear with me if some explanations seem obvious and trite.\n\nBefore the Law ‚Äî Chaos\nIn late 2015, unprecedented scale and failures were routine at Gojek. It also\nweighed heavily on culture\n[https://blog.gojekengineering.com/failures-make-us-stronger-part-2-a325cae09f20] \n‚Äî because firefighting when systems are down bogs down morale and creates a\nfractious lot. It was truly Kafkaesque. (See what I did there? üòâ). These\nfractures were common in our early days, because all developers depended on our\ncore systems.\n\nWe had about 10+ products at the time and about 60+ developers (Today, we have\n18+ products with 250+ developers overseeing them). These 60 passionate devs saw\nthe chance to build products, solve complex problems and moved fast to meet\nrapacious demand. Naturally, people were doing their own work, writing code in\ntheir own style, and had to sync with others to deploy what they wrote.\n\nAt the core of Gojek is ‚ÄòAllocations\n[https://blog.gojekengineering.com/how-go-jek-manages-1-million-drivers-with-12-engineers-part-1-978af9ccfd32]\n‚Äô; ‚Äî a classic matchmaking engine between the driver and the customer. All\nsurrounding teams depended on this one team to add features, beta test their\nofferings, and much more. If GO-FOOD wanted to allocate a 4-star driver to some\norders, they had to raise a ‚Äòticket‚Äô with the Allocations team. The Allocations\nteam then processed this for GO-FOOD.\n\nNow, think of 50 developers asking Allocations to push their features first.\n\nSoon, the org was heavily dependent on relationships. If Ekta from GO-BOX had a\nstrong relationship with Jane in Allocations, Ekta would get preference on her\nfeatures. This became problematic for us and as the org scaled, it added more\ncultural biases. Jane also became the defacto gatekeeper. Everyone had to toe\nher line if they wanted to build and deploy their own features. To add to this,\nAllocations was pushing back and severely lagging behind, because 50-odd\ndevelopers were adding and testing 10 features a day.\n\nBefore you knew it, Allocations became the bottleneck to scale the org. As if\nall that wasn‚Äôt enough, the team was not doing its own testing and experiments\nto make Allocations better and sharper. Things were spiralling downwards.\n\nA patch would not do, we needed a fix\nIt was apparent we had to fix this problem ‚Äî once and for all. The \n‚ÄòRelationship-as-a-Service‚Äô model was a disaster. RaaS was endemic in the org.\nThings were fine at a macro level, but at the base of it, we were failing.\n\nWe needed a solution that gave everyone the freedom to build and experiment. We\nwanted folks to think they‚Äôre building individual products from scratch without\nany reliance. Easier said that done, right?\n\n> This was the genesis of Gojek‚Äôs philosophy of building a #SuperApp ‚Äî a chance to\nbuild startups within a startup.\nWe wanted to unleash our best minds to build, and not worry about RaaS.After\nsome research and consensus across the board, we were all sold on Kafka. \nSoftware was going to solve our RaaS problem. Ambitious? Maybe. Pragmatic? Damn\nright.\n\nForget the morose writer\nEvery team was mandated to broadcast events on Kafka. If a driver booking was\nmade, it was sent to Kafka. If a driver completed the ride, it was sent to\nKafka. Kafka became the bus that carried the millions of events happening inside\nGojek.\n\n> Anything and everything individual teams did was visible to anyone and everyone\ninside Gojek.\nIf a team wanted to test features or roll out updates, they merely had to rely\non Kafka. No more RaaS. No more long waiting periods. This unleashed the\nproductivity of every developer. The day we rolled out Kafka, we killed the\ngatekeeper. Information was free and accessible to all. We were solving software\nproblems, but deep down, culture was the bigger fix.\n\n> Today, we emit 350,000,000 messages on Kafka and it‚Äôs every engineers‚Äô\nplayground.\nOur two-pizza team rule became far more efficient, and now we were solving\nbigger problems. This is also an example of how we look at Lean Engineering, but\nthat‚Äôs a story for another day.\n\nDas Urteil ‚Äî But positive Metamorphosis\n‚ÄòDas Urteil‚Äô means ‚ÄòThe Judgement‚Äô, and Franz Kafka published this book in 1913.\nMetamorphosis was published in 1915. The latter talks about how a salesman\nturned into an insect and struggles to live. It‚Äôs classic Franz Kafka; deeply\nsad, complex and incredibly gut-wrenching.\n\nIn our case, The Judgement was of an insect metamorphosing into a butterfly. It\ndidn‚Äôt happen overnight, but this was our tipping point. Our tech stack began to\nreflect organisation culture.\n\nKafka solved a critical cultural problem for us. üí™\n\nLiked what you read?

It can solve complex problems, so devs can focus on pressing tasks.</p><p>However, it can also complicate culture; like introducing a biometric system to track employee attendance, and have software track sick leaves.</p><blockquote>In essence, an organisation‚Äôs tech stack will reflect the health of the company.</blockquote><p>If you‚Äôre focused on writing beautiful code, it‚Äôs likely that employees are disciplined, organised, and believe in the company‚Äôs values. It‚Äôs really not that far-fetched a correlation.</p><p><strong><strong>This is a similar story; the story of Kafka ‚Äî an open source tool that solved culture for us.</strong></strong> Will try and simplify this for a broad audience, so devs, please bear with me if some explanations seem obvious and trite.</p><h3 id=\"before-the-law-chaos\">Before the Law ‚Äî Chaos</h3><p>In late 2015, unprecedented scale and failures were routine at Gojek. It also weighed heavily on <a href=\"https://blog.gojekengineering.com/failures-make-us-stronger-part-2-a325cae09f20\" rel=\"noopener\">culture</a> ‚Äî because firefighting when systems are down bogs down morale and creates a fractious lot. It was truly Kafkaesque. (See what I did there? üòâ). These fractures were common in our early days, because all developers depended on our core systems.</p><p>We had about 10+ products at the time and about 60+ developers (Today, we have 18+ products with 250+ developers overseeing them). These 60 passionate devs saw the chance to build products, solve complex problems and moved fast to meet rapacious demand. Naturally, people were doing their own work, <strong><strong>writing code in their own style,</strong></strong> and had to sync with others to deploy what they wrote.</p><p>At the core of Gojek is ‚Äò<a href=\"https://blog.gojekengineering.com/how-go-jek-manages-1-million-drivers-with-12-engineers-part-1-978af9ccfd32\" rel=\"noopener\">Allocations</a>‚Äô; ‚Äî a classic matchmaking engine between the driver and the customer. All surrounding teams depended on this one team to add features, beta test their offerings, and much more. If GO-FOOD wanted to allocate a 4-star driver to some orders, they had to raise a ‚Äòticket‚Äô with the Allocations team. The Allocations team then processed this for GO-FOOD.</p><p><em><em>Now, think of 50 developers asking Allocations to push their features first.</em></em></p><p>Soon, the org was heavily dependent on relationships. If Ekta from GO-BOX had a strong relationship with Jane in Allocations, Ekta would get preference on her features. This became problematic for us and as the org scaled, it added more cultural biases. <strong><strong>Jane also became the defacto gatekeeper.</strong> </strong>Everyone had to toe her line if they wanted to build and deploy their own features. To add to this, Allocations was pushing back and severely lagging behind, because 50-odd developers were adding and testing 10 features a day.</p><p>Before you knew it, <strong><strong>Allocations became the bottleneck to scale the org. </strong></strong>As if all that wasn‚Äôt enough, the team was not doing its own testing and experiments to make Allocations better and sharper. Things were spiralling downwards.</p><h3 id=\"a-patch-would-not-do-we-needed-a-fix\">A patch would not do, we needed a fix</h3><p>It was apparent we had to fix this problem ‚Äî once and for all. The <strong><strong>‚ÄòRelationship-as-a-Service‚Äô</strong></strong> model was a disaster. <strong><strong>RaaS</strong></strong> was endemic in the org. Things were fine at a macro level, but at the base of it, we were failing.</p><p>We needed a solution that gave everyone the freedom to build and experiment. We wanted folks to think they‚Äôre building individual products from scratch without any reliance. <strong><strong>Easier said that done, right?</strong></strong></p><blockquote>This was the genesis of Gojek‚Äôs philosophy of building a #SuperApp ‚Äî a chance to build startups within a startup.</blockquote><p>We wanted to unleash our best minds to build, and not worry about <strong><strong>RaaS.</strong></strong>After some research and consensus across the board, we were all sold on Kafka.<strong><strong> Software was going to solve our RaaS problem. Ambitious? Maybe. Pragmatic? Damn right</strong></strong>.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://gojek-ghost.zysk.in/content/images/2020/06/1_TKa_fTjcIPBZr71sSMTaFA.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><h3 id=\"forget-the-morose-writer\">Forget the morose writer</h3><p>Every team was mandated to broadcast events on Kafka. If a driver booking was made, it was sent to Kafka. If a driver completed the ride, it was sent to Kafka. Kafka became the bus that carried the millions of events happening inside Gojek.</p><blockquote>Anything and everything individual teams did was visible to anyone and everyone inside Gojek.</blockquote><p>If a team wanted to test features or roll out updates, they merely had to rely on Kafka. No more RaaS<strong><strong>.</strong></strong> No more long waiting periods. This unleashed the productivity of every developer. <strong><strong>The day we rolled out Kafka, we killed the gatekeeper. Information was free and accessible to all. </strong></strong>We were solving software problems, but deep down, culture was the bigger fix.</p><blockquote>Today, we emit 350,000,000 messages on Kafka and it‚Äôs every engineers‚Äô playground.</blockquote><p>Our two-pizza team rule became far more efficient, and now we were solving bigger problems. This is also an example of how we look at Lean Engineering, but that‚Äôs a story for another day.</p><h3 id=\"das-urteil-but-positive-metamorphosis\">Das Urteil ‚Äî But positive Metamorphosis</h3><p>‚ÄòDas Urteil‚Äô means ‚ÄòThe Judgement‚Äô, and Franz Kafka published this book in 1913. Metamorphosis was published in 1915. The latter talks about how a salesman turned into an insect and struggles to live. It‚Äôs classic Franz Kafka; deeply sad, complex and incredibly gut-wrenching.</p><p>In our case, The Judgement was of an insect metamorphosing into a butterfly. It didn‚Äôt happen overnight, but this was our tipping point. Our tech stack began to reflect organisation culture.</p><p><strong><strong>Kafka solved a critical cultural problem for us.</strong></strong> üí™</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://gojek-ghost.zysk.in/content/images/2020/06/1_Yigf1nGxRKjzV7vIC_YkYg.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>Liked what you read?

Nadiem, Andre and Kevin have been\nrunning the business together for a number of years, which will ensure that this\nleadership transition will run smoothly.\n\nNadiem‚Äôs news was communicated in an email to all Gojek staff that was sent\ntoday. In the email, he looked back on how the company has grown over the past\nnine years and also set out his hopes for the future of the business:\n\n‚ÄúWe started this company with nothing, other than a deep desire to change things\nfor the better. We saw that the streets of Jakarta were a mess and that there\nwas an informal community of ojek drivers who could easily act as a huge part of\nthe solution to that mess, if only they were organised and working efficiently.\n\n‚ÄúWith just that initial desire to improve life for everyone, as well as a large\namount of support from countless friends, partners and stakeholders, we‚Äôve\ncreated Gojek. An iconic company that flies the flag for the future of Indonesia\nand Southeast Asia.\n\n‚ÄúI will leave Gojek in the capable hands of Andre Soelistyo and Kevin Aluwi as\nco-CEOs, both of whom have played central roles in moving the company along its\npath from that office in South Jakarta onto the global stage.\n\n‚ÄúWe got very lucky as we progressed along that path, but I believe that luck in\nbusiness only really becomes a valuable commodity if you have the brilliant\nminds needed to take advantage of it. Kevin and Andre have mentored me to be the\nleader I am today. They are quite simply Gojek‚Äôs best. They have been running\nthis company for a number of years and I have complete faith not just in their\ntechnical skills and ability to execute flawlessly, but also in their integrity\nand their desire to do the right thing every step of the way.\n\n‚ÄúHigh emotions are involved in running a company like Gojek but Andre and Kevin\nare always the steady voices of reason, approaching problems with intelligence\nand compassion. I couldn‚Äôt ask for better successors as the Gojek movement\nbegins its next stage of growth.‚Äù\n\nA joint statement released by Andre and Kevin said: ‚ÄúWhen a friend and mentor\nleaves a business you have built together, there is always going to be some\nsadness, but we are both determined that Gojek will go from strength to\nstrength. We will continue to implement our vision as we focus on what the Gojek\nof the next ten years is going to be like.\n\n‚ÄúThis company has changed the lives of so many people in Indonesia and around\nthe region, and our key priority is to ensure that we can continue to act as a\npositive force in society for the foreseeable future.‚Äù\n\nUnder Andre and Kevin‚Äôs management, Gojek has grown exponentially, to process\nover two billion transactions a year. The company‚Äôs fundraising efforts have\nattracted some of the world‚Äôs most exciting companies including Google, Tencent,\nMitsubishi, Visa, AIA and Astra, with Series F set to raise well over US$2bn.\nThe company has also launched operations in Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam,\nwhile the Gojek app has become the most-used on-demand application in Indonesia,\nwhere its food and payments businesses have overtaken transport to become the\nlargest businesses within the group.\n\nWith the new structure, Andre will focus on corporate functions and management\nof capital allocation, international expansion as well as the payments and\nfinancial services businesses, while Kevin will focus on the product development\nelements of the Gojek business as well as marketing, organisational development\nand the transportation and food delivery businesses.\n\nSince co-founding Gojek, Kevin has held significant leadership roles across\nproduct and functional teams within the organisation. He has used his background\nin Business Intelligence to pioneer the use of data for decision-making across\nthe Gojek business. He has also assembled deep technology expertise across the\ndata, engineering and product teams, with a focus on enhancing the platform‚Äôs\noverall user experience. Prior to his role at Gojek, Kevin spent time at Zalora\nIndonesia, Merah Putih Incubator and Salem Partners.\n\nSimilarly, Andre has played a pivotal role in laying a solid foundation for\nGojek‚Äôs rapid growth.

It can be interpreted in a number of ways: a map\npin, the bull‚Äôs eye, an aerial view of a motorcyclist, or a power button. This\nreflects Gojek‚Äôs Super App proposition, with its multitude of offerings, which\nrange from transport, payments and food to logistics, entertainment and\nlifestyle.\n\nIn Indonesia, Gojek has built three Super Apps: one each for consumers,\ndriver-partners, and merchant partners. Each app provides its respective users\nwith services and features designed to make life better and help them to excel.\nFor example, the app for driver-partners is equipped with several functions that\nsupport financial planning, while the merchant app includes features that help\nwith business expansion, including logistics and inventory management.\n\nKevin Aluwi, Co-founder of Gojek Group, says: ‚ÄúToday, we introduce a new brand\nthat represents the evolution of Gojek from a transport company in Jakarta to a\nleading tech company in Southeast Asia. We have been on an extraordinary journey\nover the past four years and the new brand is designed to embody everything that\nhas been achieved throughout that period.\n\n‚ÄúWe are humbled that driver-partners, merchants, consumers and our employees\nhave had such faith in our brand and our company as we‚Äôve grown.
