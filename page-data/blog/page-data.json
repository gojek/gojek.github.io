Voila!! You got a driver. That was\nfast. You can see your driver’s location on the map, and the estimated time they\nwould take to come to you.\n\nBut hang on… It seems like the map is a bit messed up.\n\nThe driver location on the map goes back and forth at unreal speed, and even\nflies over buildings. Starring in an action movie is not exactly how you want to\nstart your week. 😮\n\nWhile our driver-partners sure are superman in their own unique way, they\ncertainly can’t drive over buildings. This is clearly not how your driver is\nactually driving on the road. But then why is the map showing all this?\n\nWell, there are multiple factors that can lead to a bad experience like that.\nSome within our control, some not so much (as of now). We decided to go back to\nthe drawing board and figure out the issues that are in our control and fix them\nfor good. And that is how we built a world-class (arguably 😬) live-tracking\nexperience.\n\nBut what is live-tracking, you would ask?\n\nLive tracking is a complete map experience. It doesn’t involve anything other\nthan what you see on maps after you get a driver.\n\nSo, what do you see on maps?\n\n 1. Driver's location depicted by a green marker.\n 2. The routes.\n 3. The change in driver marker as the driver moves closer to your pickup/your\n    destination.\n 4. The change in route as the driver moves.\n\nAnd that’s it. That’s all live-tracking is.\n\n> But that sounds quite simple. Right? Use some routing APIs and plot the markers\nand routes.\nWell, yes, it sounded easy to us when we first heard about it too. The real\nexperience threw us a few curveballs. Let’s go through how we create a\nlive-tracking experience.\n\nInput\nLet’s look at the input data that we need to create a live-tracking animation:\n\nDriver Location and Routes\nOur driver apps have an in-built mechanism to upload driver location to our\nbackend at regular intervals. This is how we are able to find a driver close to\nyour location when you order one of our services. The primary input to\nlive-tracking is this driver location.\n\nIn our driver app, we get this location using Android’s FusedLocationProvider \nAPI which automatically uses the best location provider(GPS, Wifi, etc). The\ndriver location is ingested into our backend system via a continuous stream.\nRoutes are generated by our internal routing engine and provided to the customer\napp.\n\nInput Source\nAs you would have guessed, this data is provided via API calls initiated by the\nour Super App to the routing engine.\n\nMaking the API call just once won’t be sufficient. Right? The app needs to be\ninformed every time the driver’s location has changed. So, the customer app\npolls this API every few seconds to get this data.\n\nNow, we have a continuous stream of data flowing to our app which has all the\ninformation that we need to show the vehicle animation on the road.\n\nTerminology\nBefore moving forward, we should get acquainted with a few terminologies that we\nwould use quite frequently in this post.\n\n 1. Route: The entire list of latitude-longitudes between the driver location to\n    the pickup/destination location.\n 2. Segment: A segment is the smallest unit of a route. It is a straight line\n    from one position in the routes list to the very next position in the routes\n    list.\n\nA route of length n has n-1 segments. Confused? Yeah, let’s take an example.\n\nA Route looks like this:\n\n[{-62441198, 106.8032959},\n{-6.2440766, 106.80328}, \n{-6.2439977, 106.8033275},\n{-6.2434893, 106.8029214},\n{-6.2433926, 106.8030539},\n{-6.2436018, 106.803222}]\n\nThere are 5 Segments in this route.\n\nSegment 1: {-6.2441198, 106.8032959,-6.2440766, 106.80328}\nSegment 2: {-6.2440766, 106.80328,-6.2439977, 106.8033275}\nSegment 3: {-6.2439977, 106.8033275,-6.2434893, 106.8029214}\nSegment 4: {-6.2434893, 106.8029214,-6.2433926, 106.8030539}\nSegment 5: {-6.2433926, 106.8030539,-6.2436018, 106.8032224}\n\nThe initial setup\nWhen the user lands on the live tracking screen, the app immediately makes a\ncall to our internal API to get the driver location and route. Once we get this\ndata, we plot it on the map using the standard GoogleMap methods. \ngoogleMap.addMarker(), googleMap.addPolyline() etc.\n\nSometimes, we don’t have the routing information available immediately, so we\njust show the driver marker. We also store this data locally in an in-memory\ncache as we would need it later to do some comparisons.\n\nSo, the customer is able to see the markers and routes on the map now. So far so\ngood.\n\nThe subsequent updates\nAs I mentioned earlier, we need to change the position of driver marker and\nroute as the driver moves. The customer app makes a call to the same internal\nAPI every few seconds. After the first response, we don’t move any markers or\nroutes on the map until the next response succeeds.\n\nIn the next response, we again get the same data points i.e the route and driver\nlocation but with different values, of course, if the driver has moved. The next\nset of data that we get can have the following characteristics:\n\n 1. Route and driver location don’t change\n 2. Route changes\n 3. Route doesn’t change BUT driver location does\n\nLet’s discuss these cases one by one.\n\n1: Route and driver location don’t change\nIf nothing has changed, we don’t need to do anything. Probably our driver\npartner is stuck in traffic. 😞\n\n2: Route changes\nThis can happen either when:\n\n 1. The app was not showing any route to the user before i.e the first response\n    didn’t have the route.\n 2. The app was showing a route that is different from the newly received route.\n    This usually happens in cases where the driver starts following a different\n    route from the one they were following before. This can also happen due to\n    road closures or simply because our driver-partner initially followed a\n    wrong route by mistake 😅.\n\nIn either of these cases, we simply ignore the old driver marker and routes\nwhich were shown and plot the new marker and routes.\n\n3: Route doesn’t change BUT driver location does\nThe app was showing the same route to the user before i.e the old response had\nthe same route as the new response. This means that the driver is following the\noriginal route that we determined.\n\nIn this case, we need to animate the driver marker on the map from the old\nlocation to the new location along the same route. This is the most common\nscenario, which can again be broken down further into multiple scenarios (yeah,\nI’m all about breaking things down 🤐).\n\n3.1: Does the new location lie on the route?\nTo animate the driver marker from it’s current position to the new location, we\nfirst need to know whether the new location lies on the route or not.\n\nYeah, we can’t be sure that the driver location that we have received would\nalways lie on the route/road because of various GPS inaccuracy issues.\n\nWe iterate through every segment in the route to find the segment which has the\nnew location. For every segment, we use the Geometry/PolyUtil library to\ndetermine whether the driver location lies on that route.\n\nWe also specify a tolerance of a few meters to account for GPS inaccuracy. So,\nif the newly received location is within a radius of X meters near a segment,\nthis method will return true.\n\nAndroid\n\nboolean isLocationOnPath(LatLng point,List<LatLng> polyline,boolean geodesic,\ndouble tolerance)\n\niOS\n\nBOOL GMSGeometryIsLocationOnPathToleranc\n[https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios-sdk/reference/group___geometry_utils#ga580ba381b9d4fbc0ff430cf69e06e66d]\ne(CLLocationCoordinate2D point,GMSPath\n[https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios-sdk/reference/interface_g_m_s_path] \n* path,BOOL geodesic,CLLocationDistance tolerance)\n\nIf the location doesn’t lie on any of the segments in the route, we are sad and\nso, we don’t animate anything. But if it does, we go forward with the next step\nwhich is….\n\n3.2: Vehicle projection on route\nWhen we receive a new location, the start location is simply the position that\nthe driver marker is already at. No logic required there to calculate that.\n\nThe end location should simply be the new location that we received. Well, in an\nideal world, it should be but we live so far away from an ideal world 😞.\n\nAs we mentioned earlier, the raw driver location that we get from the driver app\nvia GPS/other providers mostly doesn’t lie on the road. So, we have to find a\nprojection of the driver location on the road/route.\n\nIf you have been reading carefully, you might wonder why we can’t just use the \nisLocationOnPath() method above 🤔.\n\nWell, if you had been reading more carefully, you might have noticed that this\nmethod returns a boolean explaining whether the location is on/near the route or\nnot 🤦‍♂. It doesn’t return the projected location. (Ohh..if someone from Maps\nUtils stumbled upon this by chance, please add that method, good sir).\n\nSo, we had to revise some maths. Yeah, folks, learn your maths well. You never\nknow when a situation like this might arise 🤷‍♂.\n\n“Find the projection of point (x,y) on the line y = mx + c”. Does that ring a\nbell? Drawing a perpendicular line towards the segment and calculating the\nlocation of where the line and route intersect can give us the projected\nlocation. Right?\n\nWell, the above approach works for 2-D systems but earth is not a 2-D space. We\nneed a way to project the spherical surface of the earth onto a rectangle 2-D\nspace. There are several ways to do that. All of them have certain drawbacks. We\nmight lose information like direction or the shape of landmasses/countries or\nthe area information.\n\nMercator Projection\n\nMercator projection is one of the available methods to project the spherical map\nof earth onto a rectangle to make usable maps. Most of the mapping tools used\nfor navigation use this projection.\n\nThe key feature of Mercator projection is that it retains the direction\ninformation. That means if point A is 30deg east from north of point B on the\nglobe, it will be in the same direction on its Mercator projection. Or say there\nis a turn of 90deg in some lane, it will be 90deg on Mercator projection as\nwell. That is the reason it works really well for navigation purposes.\n\nHow to use a Mercator projection?\n\n 1. Every point on the earth is projected on a cylinder exactly like point A\n    which has point A’ on the cylinder.\n 2. Once all the required points/routes are projected on this cylinder. It is\n    unrolled, and we obtain a rectangle like the one shown above.\n 3. All the planar geometry can be applied with a very little margin of error on\n    this 2D projected map.\n 4. After processing all the points/routes they can be converted back to\n    latitude and longitude on the globe.\n\nSo, now we have the projected driver location on the route which we will fondly\ncall snapped point going forward.\n\n3.3: End-to-End animation\nThe new driver location that we receive can be present in any segment. It may be\nthat it is in the same segment or it may be that it is on the next segment or on\nthe next one or it may be that it is on the last segment.\n\nBut for linear animation, we need a start point and an end point. The start\npoint is the current position of the driver marker. We already got the snapped\nendpoint in the earlier section. But we can’t just animate from start to end at\nonce as that would seem like the car is flying and ignoring U-turns, routes,\netc. So, how do we prevent it from flying?\n\nWhat do you do when you can’t fly to a place? You follow the road. Right? That’s\nwhat we have to do as well. Make the driver marker follow the route/road. We\nneed to animate along each segment in the route until we reach the segment which\nhas the driver position that we received.\n\nThere are again two cases here 😜:\n\n3.3.1: The new driver location is on the same segment\nIn this case, we can directly animate from the current position of driver marker\nto the driver location that we received since this is just a straight line\nanimation.\n\nA segment is always a straight line. We will discuss more on how to do the\nanimation b/w 2 points in a later section.\n\n3.3.2: The new driver location is on a different segment\nIn this case, we need to animate to that segment along the route. We have to\nanimate along each of the segments in between to reach the final segment.\n\nFor animation along the first segment, we set the endpoint of the animation to\nthe beginning of the next segment in the route. We animate to the end of the\nfirst segment.\n\nThe next segment may also not have the driver location that we received. After a\ndriver has traversed the first segment, we move the end location of the\nanimation to the end of the next segment, and so on and so forth till we reach\nthe last segment. Confusing, ya? Let’s see an example.\n\nSo much zig-zag (huh!!)The car icon(A) represents the location in the segment\nwhere the driver marker currently is. The red pin(X) represents the new snapped\nlocation received.\n\nIn the 1st animation, we move the driver marker from A to the end of the first\nsegment (B).\n\nIn the 2nd animation, the driver marker is moved through the entire length of\nthe 2nd segment.\n\nAnd so on and so forth till we reach the segment which has the newly received\nsnapped location (X).\n\nAnimation in a segment\nWe now know how the overall animation would look like. But we also need to\nconfigure how the smallest unit of the animation i.e animation in a segment\nshould happen.\n\nStart point and End point: For case #1 above, the animation in a segment will\nhappen just once. For case #2 above, this animation in a segment will happen\nmultiple times. Start and endpoints will be determined before beginning each of\nthe animations.\n\nBearing b/w these two points: Bearing can be calculated using another one of\nGeometry/Maps Utils method.\n\nSphericalUtil.computeHeading(startPosition, endPosition)\n\nDuration of animation: Calculating duration is a bit tricky. And the duration is\nthe most important thing in any animation. Sometimes the difference b/w a smooth\nand a choppy animation is caused by the duration. It was very important that we\ngot it right. So, let’s take a break and see how to calculate the duration.\n\nWhat is Duration?\nIt’s the amount of time for which the animation should happen. But you already\nknow that. Going back to middle school maths (yeah, that far), how do you\ncalculate time? Time is nothing but distance divided by speed. Correct?\nCalculating straight line distance b/w the two points we want to animate through\nis pretty easy.\n\nSphericalUtil.computeDistanceBetween(startLocation, endLocation)\n\nCool, cool. But what about speed? How should we calculate speed?\n\nSpeed calculation\nFusedLocationProvider API in the driver app does provide the speed of the\nvehicle but it’s highly unreliable. So, we have to employ some tricks to\ncalculate the speed.\n\nSpeed is distance divided by time. Distance again!! Seems like we are running in\ncircles 😵. Not exactly. Here the distance is not the straight line distance b/w\nthe two points that we have to animate through.\n\nThis is the total distance along the route from the segment that the old driver\nlocation is currently located at, to the segment where the new driver location\nis. Yeah, that statement is a bit confusing. So, let’s take an example.\n\nThe car icon(A) represents the location in the segment where the driver marker\ncurrently is. The red pin(X) represents the new snapped location received. To\ncalculate the distance, we do the obvious:\n\nTotal distance = d1 + d2 + d3 + d4\n\nNow, we have the distance. We need the time interval.\n\nThe FusedLocationProvider API in the driver app does provide us the timestamp at\nwhich a location was updated. And this information is passed to our backend and\nsubsequently to the customer app.\n\nWe calculate the time difference b/w the old driver location and the new driver\nlocation using their timestamps. Wait, how do we know the old driver location?\nAs we had mentioned earlier, we cache the last available driver location and\nroute in an in-memory cache.\n\nTotal route distance divided by time and now we have the speed for the entire\nduration. Linear distance divided by this speed and now we have the durationfor\na single animation in a segment. Cool, so let’s get back to the point where we\nbroke off 😅.\n\nUpdate the animation\nWith all the above information, we start the animation. But wait? Aren’t we\nmissing something? We did start an animation b/w two points but how will our\nanimator know how to animate?\n\nAnimation is just a bunch of frame updates that happen every fast. How do we\nupdate the marker position, the starting point of the route, the rotation in\neach and every frame of the animation? Well, the mobile/web framework allows us\nto do something every time the frame is updated.\n\nBut what is this something that we should do?\n\n1. Update marker’s position\nFor markers, we need to update their position. Once we have the position, we can\nsimply update the marker position using the marker.setPosition(). To find the\nposition during each frame of the animation, we need the percentage of animation\nthat has elapsed.\n\nWe can get the percentage from the Animation framework. Using this percentage\nand the start and end position, we calculate the intermediate position/s like\nthis:\n\nSphericalUtil.interpolate(startPosition, endPosition, fraction)\n\n2. Update Routes\nRoutes need to be aligned with the marker’s movement. So, we update the routes\nas well using the values above and updating the polyline points of that route\nusing the polyline.setPoints().\n\nAnd that’s a wrap. The result that we get is a very smooth, measured movement of\nthe vehicle along the road.\n\nThere are a few more tips/tricks that we employ to ensure that there are no\nabrupt changes in the animation.\n\nBut that’s for next time. 😃\n\nWhat’s next?\nWe still need to go a long way to meet the standards that we have set for\nourselves. Currently, this new experience is only rolled out to GoRide, GoCar,\nand GoBluebird. We are working on bringing the same experience to other services\nlike GoFood, GoSend, and GoShop.

Voila!! You got a driver. That was fast. You can see your driver’s location on the map, and the estimated time they would take to come to you.</p><p><em><em>But hang on… It seems like the map is a bit messed up.</em></em></p><p>The driver location on the map goes back and forth at unreal speed, and even flies over buildings. Starring in an action movie is not exactly how you want to start your week. 😮</p><p>While our driver-partners sure are superman in their own unique way, they certainly can’t drive over buildings. This is clearly not how your driver is actually driving on the road. But then why is the map showing all this?</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://gojek-ghost.zysk.in/content/images/2020/05/LiveTracking2.gif\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>Well, there are multiple factors that can lead to a bad experience like that. Some within our control, some not so much (as of now). We decided to go back to the drawing board and figure out the issues that are in our control and fix them for good. And that is how we built a world-class (arguably 😬) live-tracking experience.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://gojek-ghost.zysk.in/content/images/2020/05/image.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>But what is live-tracking, you would ask?</p><p>Live tracking is a complete map experience. It doesn’t involve anything other than what you see on maps after you get a driver.</p><p>So, what do you see on maps?</p><ol><li>Driver's location depicted by a green marker.</li><li>The routes.</li><li>The change in driver marker as the driver moves closer to your pickup/your destination.</li><li>The change in route as the driver moves.</li></ol><p>And that’s it. That’s all live-tracking is.</p><blockquote><em><em>But that sounds quite simple. Right? Use some routing APIs and plot the markers and routes.</em></em></blockquote><p>Well, yes, it sounded easy to us when we first heard about it too. The real experience threw us a few curveballs. Let’s go through how we create a live-tracking experience.</p><h3 id=\"input\">Input</h3><p>Let’s look at the input data that we need to create a live-tracking animation:</p><h3 id=\"driver-location-and-routes\">Driver Location and Routes</h3><p>Our driver apps have an in-built mechanism to upload driver location to our backend at regular intervals. This is how we are able to find a driver close to your location when you order one of our services. The primary input to live-tracking is this driver location.</p><p>In our driver app, we get this location using Android’s <code>FusedLocationProvider</code> API which automatically uses the best location provider(GPS, Wifi, etc). The driver location is ingested into our backend system via a continuous stream. Routes are generated by our internal routing engine and provided to the customer app.</p><h3 id=\"input-source\">Input Source</h3><p>As you would have guessed, this data is provided via API calls initiated by the our Super App to the routing engine.</p><p>Making the API call just once won’t be sufficient. Right? The app needs to be informed every time the driver’s location has changed. So, the customer app polls this API every few seconds to get this data.</p><p>Now, we have a continuous stream of data flowing to our app which has all the information that we need to show the vehicle animation on the road.</p><h3 id=\"terminology\">Terminology</h3><p>Before moving forward, we should get acquainted with a few terminologies that we would use quite frequently in this post.</p><ol><li><strong><strong>Route</strong></strong>: The entire list of latitude-longitudes between the driver location to the pickup/destination location.</li><li><strong><strong>Segment</strong></strong>: A segment is the smallest unit of a route. It is a straight line from one position in the routes list to the very next position in the routes list.</li></ol><p>A route of length n has n-1 segments. Confused? Yeah, let’s take an example.</p><p>A <strong><strong>Route</strong></strong> looks like this:</p><p>[{-6<code>2441198, 106.8032959},<br>{-6.2440766, 106.80328}, <br>{-6.2439977, 106.8033275},<br>{-6.2434893, 106.8029214},<br>{-6.2433926, 106.8030539},<br>{-6.2436018, 106.803222}]</code></p><p>There are 5 <strong><strong>Segments</strong></strong> in this route.</p><p><code>Segment 1: {-6.2441198, 106.8032959,-6.2440766, 106.80328}</code><br><code>Segment 2: {-6.2440766, 106.80328,-6.2439977, 106.8033275}</code><br><code>Segment 3: {-6.2439977, 106.8033275,-6.2434893, 106.8029214}</code><br><code>Segment 4: {-6.2434893, 106.8029214,-6.2433926, 106.8030539}</code><br><code>Segment 5: {-6.2433926, 106.8030539,-6.2436018, 106.8032224}</code></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://gojek-ghost.zysk.in/content/images/2020/05/image-1.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><h3 id=\"the-initial-setup\">The initial setup</h3><p>When the user lands on the live tracking screen, the app immediately makes a call to our internal API to get the driver location and route. Once we get this data, we plot it on the map using the standard GoogleMap methods. <code><em><em>googleMap.addMarker()</em></em></code><em><em>, </em></em><code><em><em>googleMap.addPolyline()</em></em></code> etc.</p><p>Sometimes, we don’t have the routing information available immediately, so we just show the driver marker. We also store this data locally in an in-memory cache as we would need it later to do some comparisons.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/436/1*k9IpgQ4ss-bhKHBY5ETUgg.gif\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>So, the customer is able to see the markers and routes on the map now. So far so good.</p><h3 id=\"the-subsequent-updates\">The subsequent updates</h3><p>As I mentioned earlier, we need to change the position of driver marker and route as the driver moves. The customer app makes a call to the same internal API every few seconds. After the first response, we don’t move any markers or routes on the map until the next response succeeds.</p><p>In the next response, we again get the same data points i.e the route and driver location but with different values, of course, <strong><strong>if the driver has moved</strong></strong>. The next set of data that we get can have the following characteristics:</p><ol><li>Route and driver location don’t change</li><li>Route changes</li><li>Route doesn’t change BUT driver location does</li></ol><p>Let’s discuss these cases one by one.</p><h3 id=\"1-route-and-driver-location-don-t-change\">1: Route and driver location don’t change</h3><p>If nothing has changed, we don’t need to do anything. Probably our driver partner is stuck in traffic. 😞</p><h3 id=\"2-route-changes\">2: Route changes</h3><p>This can happen either when:</p><ol><li>The app was not showing any route to the user before i.e the first response didn’t have the route.</li><li>The app was showing a route that is different from the newly received route. This usually happens in cases where the driver starts following a different route from the one they were following before. This can also happen due to road closures or simply because our driver-partner initially followed a wrong route by mistake 😅.</li></ol><p>In either of these cases, we simply ignore the old driver marker and routes which were shown and plot the new marker and routes.</p><h3 id=\"3-route-doesn-t-change-but-driver-location-does\">3: Route doesn’t change BUT driver location does</h3><p>The app was showing the same route to the user before i.e the old response had the same route as the new response. This means that the driver is following the original route that we determined.</p><p>In this case, we need to animate the driver marker on the map from the old location to the new location along the same route. This is the most common scenario, which can again be broken down further into multiple scenarios (yeah, I’m all about breaking things down 🤐).</p><h3 id=\"3-1-does-the-new-location-lie-on-the-route\">3.1: Does the new location lie on the route?</h3><p>To animate the driver marker from it’s current position to the new location, we first need to know whether the new location lies on the route or not.</p><p>Yeah, we can’t be sure that the driver location that we have received would always lie on the route/road because of various GPS inaccuracy issues.</p><p>We iterate through every segment in the route to find the segment which has the new location. For every segment, we use the Geometry/PolyUtil library to determine whether the driver location lies on that route.</p><p>We also specify a tolerance of a few meters to account for GPS inaccuracy. So, if the newly received location is within a radius of <strong><strong>X meters</strong></strong> near a segment, this method will return true.</p><p><strong><strong>Android</strong></strong></p><p><code>boolean isLocationOnPath(LatLng point,List&lt;LatLng&gt; polyline,boolean geodesic, double tolerance)</code></p><p><strong><strong>iOS</strong></strong></p><p><code>BOOL <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios-sdk/reference/group___geometry_utils#ga580ba381b9d4fbc0ff430cf69e06e66d\" rel=\"noopener\">GMSGeometryIsLocationOnPathToleranc</a>e(CLLocationCoordinate2D point,<a href=\"https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios-sdk/reference/interface_g_m_s_path\" rel=\"noopener\">GMSPath</a> * path,BOOL geodesic,CLLocationDistance tolerance)</code></p><p>If the location doesn’t lie on any of the segments in the route, we are sad and so, we don’t animate anything. But if it does, we go forward with the next step which is….</p><h3 id=\"3-2-vehicle-projection-on-route\">3.2: Vehicle projection on route</h3><p>When we receive a new location, the start location is simply the position that the driver marker is already at. No logic required there to calculate that.</p><p>The end location should simply be the new location that we received. Well, in an ideal world, it <strong><strong>should be</strong></strong> but we live so far away from an ideal world 😞.</p><p>As we mentioned earlier, the raw driver location that we get from the driver app via GPS/other providers mostly doesn’t lie on the road. So, we have to find a projection of the driver location on the road/route.</p><p>If you have been reading carefully, you might wonder why we can’t just use the <em><em>isLocationOnPath()</em></em> method above 🤔.</p><p>Well, if you had been reading <em><em>more</em></em> carefully, you might have noticed that this method returns a boolean explaining whether the location is on/near the route or not 🤦‍♂. It doesn’t return the projected location. (Ohh..if someone from Maps Utils stumbled upon this by chance, please add that method, good sir).</p><p>So, we had to revise some maths. Yeah, folks, learn your maths well. You never know when a situation like this might arise 🤷‍♂.</p><p><em><em>“Find the projection of point (x,y) on the line y = mx + c”.</em></em> Does that ring a bell? Drawing a perpendicular line towards the segment and calculating the location of where the line and route intersect can give us the projected location. Right?</p><p>Well, the above approach works for 2-D systems but earth is not a 2-D space. We need a way to project the spherical surface of the earth onto a rectangle 2-D space. There are several ways to do that. All of them have certain drawbacks. We might lose information like direction or the shape of landmasses/countries or the area information.</p><p><strong><strong>Mercator Projection</strong></strong></p><p>Mercator projection is one of the available methods to project the spherical map of earth onto a rectangle to make usable maps. Most of the mapping tools used for navigation use this projection.</p><p>The key feature of Mercator projection is that it retains the direction information. That means if point A is 30deg east from north of point B on the globe, it will be in the same direction on its Mercator projection. Or say there is a turn of 90deg in some lane, it will be 90deg on Mercator projection as well. That is the reason it works really well for navigation purposes.</p><p><strong><strong>How to use a Mercator projection?</strong></strong></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://gojek-ghost.zysk.in/content/images/2020/05/image-4.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://gojek-ghost.zysk.in/content/images/2020/05/image-5.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><ol><li>Every point on the earth is projected on a cylinder exactly like point A which has point A’ on the cylinder.</li><li>Once all the required points/routes are projected on this cylinder. It is unrolled, and we obtain a rectangle like the one shown above.</li><li>All the planar geometry can be applied with a very little margin of error on this 2D projected map.</li><li>After processing all the points/routes they can be converted back to latitude and longitude on the globe.</li></ol><p>So, now we have the projected driver location on the route which we will fondly call <code>snapped point</code> going forward.</p><h3 id=\"3-3-end-to-end-animation\">3.3: End-to-End animation</h3><p>The new driver location that we receive can be present in <strong><strong>any</strong></strong> segment. It may be that it is in the same segment or it may be that it is on the next segment or on the next one or it may be that it is on the last segment.</p><p>But for linear animation, we need a start point and an end point. The start point is the current position of the driver marker. We already got the snapped endpoint in the earlier section. But we can’t just animate from start to end <strong><strong>at once</strong></strong> as that would seem like the car is flying and ignoring U-turns, routes, etc. So, how do we prevent it from flying?</p><p>What do you do when you can’t fly to a place? You follow the road. Right? That’s what we have to do as well. Make the driver marker follow the route/road. We need to animate along each segment in the route until we reach the segment which has the driver position that we received.</p><p>There are again two cases here 😜:</p><h3 id=\"3-3-1-the-new-driver-location-is-on-the-same-segment\">3.3.1: The new driver location is on the same segment</h3><p>In this case, we can directly animate from the current position of driver marker to the driver location that we received since this is just a straight line animation.</p><p>A segment is always a straight line. We will discuss more on how to do the animation b/w 2 points in a later section.</p><h3 id=\"3-3-2-the-new-driver-location-is-on-a-different-segment\">3.3.2: The new driver location is on a different segment</h3><p>In this case, we need to animate to that segment along the route. We have to animate along each of the segments in between to reach the final segment.</p><p>For animation along the first segment, we set the endpoint of the animation to the beginning of the next segment in the route. We animate to the end of the first segment.</p><p>The next segment may also not have the driver location that we received. After a driver has traversed the first segment, we move the end location of the animation to the end of the next segment, and so on and so forth till we reach the last segment. Confusing, ya? Let’s see an example.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://gojek-ghost.zysk.in/content/images/2020/05/Screenshot-2020-05-23-at-10.06.55-PM.png\" class=\"kg-image\"><figcaption>So much zig-zag (huh!!)</figcaption></figure><p>The car icon(A) represents the location in the segment where the driver marker currently is.

Here’s\nan example:\n\nThis saves customers the hassle of calling the driver partner, explaining where\nthey are, what colour clothes they are wearing, and so on. Our pickup points are\ndesigned to make lives easier for both customers and driver partners.\n\nThis is possible because the pickup points shown on the app are popular pickup\nlocations around the area. What’s more, the pickup point names are displayed\nexactly how customers driver partners usually refer to them.\n\nBut how do we manage to name so many pickup points accurately, and at scale?\n\nWe use past booking locations and their associated chat logs to discover named\npickup points. As our previous research has explained, we first perform \nclustering\n[https://blog.gojekengineering.com/fantastic-drivers-and-how-to-find-them-a88239ef3b29] \non historical bookings to form potential pickup points, then we use a language\nmodel\n[https://blog.gojekengineering.com/how-i-met-my-gojek-driver-without-a-single-call-95041f4fdd03] \nto select the best name. Here, we explain how we improved upon the previous\nstatistical language model with a state-of-the-art NLP model, which makes the\nentire naming exercise fully scalable. This is the magic behind all the pickup\npoints seen on the Gojek app.\n\nHow can we learn better?\nAs explained in our previous post, our original statistical language model\nselects the best pickup point name from the most probable n-grams extracted from\nbookings text. However, such a statistical language model doesn’t ‘understand’\nthe meaning of the texts, it simply chooses phrases with high frequencies\nwithout knowing the semantics. Sometimes it throws street names, sometimes even\ncommon phrases with no information about location. We have to manually check\neverything to make sure it reflects the right POI, before it appears on the app.\n\nThis creates a challenge — especially if we want to quickly expand the\nfrictionless pickup experience to customers across in new geographies. Hence, we\ndecided to go a step further with a deep-learning NLP model that ‘understands’\nand ‘learns’ to differentiate what is a valid pickup point name.\n\nAt Gojek, we never stop thinking and always go a step further\n\nMeet CartoBERT ?\nOne of the most recent and impactful breakthroughs NLP was the publication of\nBERT[1] — a contextual language representation with transformer models — by\nGoogle in late 2018. It obtained state-of-the-art results on a wide array of NLP\ntasks. In the 2019, many NLP researches were influenced by BERT, including\nXLNet, RoBERTa, ERNIE etc.\n\nBERT Explained\nBERT, or Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, is composed of\nan embedding layer, followed by groups of transformer layers.\n\nEvery word (token) in the input sentence will first get encoded into its\nembedding representations in the embedding layer, and then go through\nbidirectional transformer encoder layers. Every encoder layer will perform the\nmulti-head attention computation on the token representation from the previous\nlayer to create a new intermediate representation, which is then output to the\nnext layer. The output from the final layer is the contextual representation of\nthe input token. A pooled sentence level representation combining all token\nrepresentations could be created if needed by specific downstream tasks.\n\nWith the final contextual representations at either token or sentence level, a\npre-trained BERT on large unlabelled text corpus, could be further extended to a\nwide variety of NLP tasks, such as text classification, question answering,\nNamed Entity Recognition (NER) etc.\n\nALBERT[2], published by Google in Sep 2019, improved on BERT with embedding\nparameter factorisation and cross layer parameter sharing to reduce the number\nof parameters (by 9 times for base model). It also uses sequence order\nprediction instead of next sentence prediction for the pre-train task. In the\npaper, ALBERT also outperforms BERT on standard NLP tasks/datasets (SQUAD, RACE\netc), with fewer parameters.\n\nPre-train CartoBERT to learn language representation from Gojek bookings text\nInspired by ALBERT’s lightweight model and performance, we developed CartoBERT,\nGojek’s very own pickup point name recognition model, based on ALBERT’s\narchitecture.\n\nAs illustrated below, the uncased CartoBERT is pre-trained on Gojek’s own masked\nbookings text corpus of about 200 million sentences. Booking text is first\npre-processed for data masking to mask all customer sensitive information,\nlanguage detection, text normalisation (including text cleaning, slang,\nabbreviation transformations, lowercase transformation and emoji removal). The\npre-processed text is used to build subword vocabularies which handles\nOut-Of-Vocabulary (OOV) tokens that could be decomposed to frequent subword\npatterns. CartoBERT tokenizer is then created with the subword vocabularies and\nfurther used to encode and tokenize the same preprocessed bookings text to form\npre-trained input files.\n\nSame as ALBERT, the model is pre-trained to ‘understand’ Gojek’s bookings text\nusing Masked Language Model — which predicts randomly masked tokens in input\nsentences — and Sentence Order Prediction tasks, which predicts the order of\ninput sentences pair.\n\nFine-tuning CartoBERT to extract pickup point names from Gojek bookings text\nWith the huge amount of bookings text we have at Gojek, now CartoBERT can better\n‘understand’ past bookings text. Theoretically, it ‘understands’ every word of a\nbooking text sentence.\n\nFor every token in the input sentence, CartoBERT will output a 768-dimension\nvector (we use the default hidden layer size of the ALBERT base model in\nCartoBERT, however this is configurable) from last transformer encoder layer,\nand we use that to represent CartoBERT’s ‘understanding’ of the token’s meaning\nin the sentence context for fine-tune step.\n\nAs illustrated in the diagram below, while fine-tuning CartoBERT for pickup\npoint name recognition, we replace the Masked Language Model and Sequence Order\nPrediction layers from CartoBERT in pre-train step with token classification\nlayer. The token classification layer learns to predict the probability of a\ntoken belonging to a pickup point name, with the final token representation\noutput from CartoBERT transformer layers, from labelled training data created\nwith bookings text sentences, and corresponding pickup point names. Here, we use\nweighted cross entropy loss to deal with class imbalance, as tokens tagged to\npickup point names are a minority.\n\n\n\nWith this, CartoBERT is fine-tuned to extract pickup point names from bookings\ntext sentences, if any.\n\nHow does the model perform?\nCartoBERT gives a lift of more than 25% in pickup point name accuracy to ~93%\naccuracy, which is measured as the percentage of valid pick up point names out\nof generated names. With this high accuracy, we have achieved full scalability\nof automatic generation for named pickup points to quickly cover multiple\ngeographies without heavy reliance on human inputs.\n\nWhat’s next?\nWe are not stopping here and are exploring using active learning to further\nimprove CartoBERT. With active learning, we only flag out uncertain predictions,\nwhich are measured as sentence level least token probability[3] for human\nlabelling. We then use human-curated data as feedback for model learning.

Here’s an example:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/180/1*msS7z4IN06LVM0XvClmmPQ.gif\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>This saves customers the hassle of calling the driver partner, explaining where they are, what colour clothes they are wearing, and so on. Our pickup points are designed to make lives easier for both customers and driver partners.</p><p>This is possible because the pickup points shown on the app are popular pickup locations around the area. What’s more, the pickup point names are displayed exactly how customers driver partners usually refer to them.</p><p><strong><strong>But how do we manage to name so many pickup points accurately, and at scale?</strong></strong></p><p>We use past booking locations and their associated chat logs to discover named pickup points. As our previous research has explained, we first perform <a href=\"https://blog.gojekengineering.com/fantastic-drivers-and-how-to-find-them-a88239ef3b29\" rel=\"noopener\">clustering</a> on historical bookings to form potential pickup points, then we use a <a href=\"https://blog.gojekengineering.com/how-i-met-my-gojek-driver-without-a-single-call-95041f4fdd03\" rel=\"noopener\">language model</a> to select the best name. Here, we explain how we improved upon the previous statistical language model with a state-of-the-art NLP model, which makes the entire naming exercise fully scalable. This is the magic behind all the pickup points seen on the Gojek app.</p><h1 id=\"how-can-we-learn-better\">How can we learn better?</h1><p>As explained in our previous post, our original statistical language model selects the best pickup point name from the most probable n-grams extracted from bookings text. However, such a statistical language model doesn’t ‘understand’ the meaning of the texts, it simply chooses phrases with high frequencies without knowing the semantics. Sometimes it throws street names, sometimes even common phrases with no information about location. We have to manually check everything to make sure it reflects the right POI, before it appears on the app.</p><p>This creates a challenge — especially if we want to quickly expand the frictionless pickup experience to customers across in new geographies. Hence, we decided to go a step further with a deep-learning NLP model that ‘understands’ and ‘learns’ to differentiate what is a valid pickup point name.</p><p><em><em>At Gojek, we never stop thinking and always go a step further</em></em></p><h1 id=\"meet-cartobert-\">Meet CartoBERT ?</h1><p>One of the most recent and impactful breakthroughs NLP was the publication of BERT[1] — a contextual language representation with transformer models — by Google in late 2018. It obtained state-of-the-art results on a wide array of NLP tasks. In the 2019, many NLP researches were influenced by BERT, including XLNet, RoBERTa, ERNIE etc.</p><h2 id=\"bert-explained\">BERT Explained</h2><p>BERT, or Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, is composed of an embedding layer, followed by groups of transformer layers.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1226/1*qHFXdPcW_3UkLEsRJy2FRg.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>Every word (token) in the input sentence will first get encoded into its embedding representations in the embedding layer, and then go through bidirectional transformer encoder layers. Every encoder layer will perform the multi-head attention computation on the token representation from the previous layer to create a new intermediate representation, which is then output to the next layer. The output from the final layer is the contextual representation of the input token. A pooled sentence level representation combining all token representations could be created if needed by specific downstream tasks.</p><p>With the final contextual representations at either token or sentence level, a pre-trained BERT on large unlabelled text corpus, could be further extended to a wide variety of NLP tasks, such as text classification, question answering, Named Entity Recognition (NER) etc.</p><p>ALBERT[2], published by Google in Sep 2019, improved on BERT with embedding parameter factorisation and cross layer parameter sharing to reduce the number of parameters (by 9 times for base model). It also uses sequence order prediction instead of next sentence prediction for the pre-train task. In the paper, ALBERT also outperforms BERT on standard NLP tasks/datasets (SQUAD, RACE etc), with fewer parameters.</p><h2 id=\"pre-train-cartobert-to-learn-language-representation-from-gojek-bookings-text\">Pre-train CartoBERT to learn language representation from Gojek bookings text</h2><p>Inspired by ALBERT’s lightweight model and performance, we developed CartoBERT, Gojek’s very own pickup point name recognition model, based on ALBERT’s architecture.</p><p>As illustrated below, the uncased CartoBERT is pre-trained on Gojek’s own masked bookings text corpus of about 200 million sentences. Booking text is first pre-processed for data masking to mask all customer sensitive information, language detection, text normalisation (including text cleaning, slang, abbreviation transformations, lowercase transformation and emoji removal). The pre-processed text is used to build subword vocabularies which handles Out-Of-Vocabulary (OOV) tokens that could be decomposed to frequent subword patterns. CartoBERT tokenizer is then created with the subword vocabularies and further used to encode and tokenize the same preprocessed bookings text to form pre-trained input files.</p><p>Same as ALBERT, the model is pre-trained to ‘understand’ Gojek’s bookings text using Masked Language Model — which predicts randomly masked tokens in input sentences — and Sentence Order Prediction tasks, which predicts the order of input sentences pair.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1386/1*STaqWssxlYPhFaDulLwJzg.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><h2 id=\"fine-tuning-cartobert-to-extract-pickup-point-names-from-gojek-bookings-text\">Fine-tuning CartoBERT to extract pickup point names from Gojek bookings text</h2><p>With the huge amount of bookings text we have at Gojek, now CartoBERT can better ‘understand’ past bookings text. Theoretically, it ‘understands’ every word of a booking text sentence.</p><p>For every token in the input sentence, CartoBERT will output a 768-dimension vector (we use the default hidden layer size of the ALBERT base model in CartoBERT, however this is configurable) from last transformer encoder layer, and we use that to represent CartoBERT’s ‘understanding’ of the token’s meaning in the sentence context for fine-tune step.</p><p>As illustrated in the diagram below, while fine-tuning CartoBERT for pickup point name recognition, we replace the Masked Language Model and Sequence Order Prediction layers from CartoBERT in pre-train step with token classification layer. The token classification layer learns to predict the probability of a token belonging to a pickup point name, with the final token representation output from CartoBERT transformer layers, from labelled training data created with bookings text sentences, and corresponding pickup point names. Here, we use weighted cross entropy loss to deal with class imbalance, as tokens tagged to pickup point names are a minority.</p><p></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1526/1*WO1LRHQPqAqzpLBMMl-NuA.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>With this, CartoBERT is fine-tuned to extract pickup point names from bookings text sentences, if any.</p><h2 id=\"how-does-the-model-perform\">How does the model perform?</h2><p>CartoBERT gives a lift of more than 25% in pickup point name accuracy to ~93% accuracy, which is measured as the percentage of valid pick up point names out of generated names. With this high accuracy, we have achieved full scalability of automatic generation for named pickup points to quickly cover multiple geographies without heavy reliance on human inputs.</p><h1 id=\"what-s-next\">What’s next?</h1><p>We are not stopping here and are exploring using active learning to further improve CartoBERT. With active learning, we only flag out uncertain predictions, which are measured as sentence level least token probability[3] for human labelling. We then use human-curated data as feedback for model learning. In this way, we can improve model learning efficiency with minimum labelling effort.</p><p>What’s more, with the success of CartoBERT, we are considering pre-training and open sourcing a general Indonesia Bahasa ALBERT model with Indonesia open corpus from wiki, news, Twitter etc. Currently, the options for open-sourced language model in Indonesia Bahasa are very limited, only pre-trained static word embeddings such as word2vec, fasttext etc are available.

Voila!! You got a driver. That was\nfast. You can see your driver’s location on the map, and the estimated time they\nwould take to come to you.\n\nBut hang on… It seems like the map is a bit messed up.\n\nThe driver location on the map goes back and forth at unreal speed, and even\nflies over buildings. Starring in an action movie is not exactly how you want to\nstart your week. 😮\n\nWhile our driver-partners sure are superman in their own unique way, they\ncertainly can’t drive over buildings. This is clearly not how your driver is\nactually driving on the road. But then why is the map showing all this?\n\nWell, there are multiple factors that can lead to a bad experience like that.\nSome within our control, some not so much (as of now). We decided to go back to\nthe drawing board and figure out the issues that are in our control and fix them\nfor good. And that is how we built a world-class (arguably 😬) live-tracking\nexperience.\n\nBut what is live-tracking, you would ask?\n\nLive tracking is a complete map experience. It doesn’t involve anything other\nthan what you see on maps after you get a driver.\n\nSo, what do you see on maps?\n\n 1. Driver's location depicted by a green marker.\n 2. The routes.\n 3. The change in driver marker as the driver moves closer to your pickup/your\n    destination.\n 4. The change in route as the driver moves.\n\nAnd that’s it. That’s all live-tracking is.\n\n> But that sounds quite simple. Right? Use some routing APIs and plot the markers\nand routes.\nWell, yes, it sounded easy to us when we first heard about it too. The real\nexperience threw us a few curveballs. Let’s go through how we create a\nlive-tracking experience.\n\nInput\nLet’s look at the input data that we need to create a live-tracking animation:\n\nDriver Location and Routes\nOur driver apps have an in-built mechanism to upload driver location to our\nbackend at regular intervals. This is how we are able to find a driver close to\nyour location when you order one of our services. The primary input to\nlive-tracking is this driver location.\n\nIn our driver app, we get this location using Android’s FusedLocationProvider \nAPI which automatically uses the best location provider(GPS, Wifi, etc). The\ndriver location is ingested into our backend system via a continuous stream.\nRoutes are generated by our internal routing engine and provided to the customer\napp.\n\nInput Source\nAs you would have guessed, this data is provided via API calls initiated by the\nour Super App to the routing engine.\n\nMaking the API call just once won’t be sufficient. Right? The app needs to be\ninformed every time the driver’s location has changed. So, the customer app\npolls this API every few seconds to get this data.\n\nNow, we have a continuous stream of data flowing to our app which has all the\ninformation that we need to show the vehicle animation on the road.\n\nTerminology\nBefore moving forward, we should get acquainted with a few terminologies that we\nwould use quite frequently in this post.\n\n 1. Route: The entire list of latitude-longitudes between the driver location to\n    the pickup/destination location.\n 2. Segment: A segment is the smallest unit of a route. It is a straight line\n    from one position in the routes list to the very next position in the routes\n    list.\n\nA route of length n has n-1 segments. Confused? Yeah, let’s take an example.\n\nA Route looks like this:\n\n[{-62441198, 106.8032959},\n{-6.2440766, 106.80328}, \n{-6.2439977, 106.8033275},\n{-6.2434893, 106.8029214},\n{-6.2433926, 106.8030539},\n{-6.2436018, 106.803222}]\n\nThere are 5 Segments in this route.\n\nSegment 1: {-6.2441198, 106.8032959,-6.2440766, 106.80328}\nSegment 2: {-6.2440766, 106.80328,-6.2439977, 106.8033275}\nSegment 3: {-6.2439977, 106.8033275,-6.2434893, 106.8029214}\nSegment 4: {-6.2434893, 106.8029214,-6.2433926, 106.8030539}\nSegment 5: {-6.2433926, 106.8030539,-6.2436018, 106.8032224}\n\nThe initial setup\nWhen the user lands on the live tracking screen, the app immediately makes a\ncall to our internal API to get the driver location and route. Once we get this\ndata, we plot it on the map using the standard GoogleMap methods. \ngoogleMap.addMarker(), googleMap.addPolyline() etc.\n\nSometimes, we don’t have the routing information available immediately, so we\njust show the driver marker. We also store this data locally in an in-memory\ncache as we would need it later to do some comparisons.\n\nSo, the customer is able to see the markers and routes on the map now. So far so\ngood.\n\nThe subsequent updates\nAs I mentioned earlier, we need to change the position of driver marker and\nroute as the driver moves. The customer app makes a call to the same internal\nAPI every few seconds. After the first response, we don’t move any markers or\nroutes on the map until the next response succeeds.\n\nIn the next response, we again get the same data points i.e the route and driver\nlocation but with different values, of course, if the driver has moved. The next\nset of data that we get can have the following characteristics:\n\n 1. Route and driver location don’t change\n 2. Route changes\n 3. Route doesn’t change BUT driver location does\n\nLet’s discuss these cases one by one.\n\n1: Route and driver location don’t change\nIf nothing has changed, we don’t need to do anything. Probably our driver\npartner is stuck in traffic. 😞\n\n2: Route changes\nThis can happen either when:\n\n 1. The app was not showing any route to the user before i.e the first response\n    didn’t have the route.\n 2. The app was showing a route that is different from the newly received route.\n    This usually happens in cases where the driver starts following a different\n    route from the one they were following before. This can also happen due to\n    road closures or simply because our driver-partner initially followed a\n    wrong route by mistake 😅.\n\nIn either of these cases, we simply ignore the old driver marker and routes\nwhich were shown and plot the new marker and routes.\n\n3: Route doesn’t change BUT driver location does\nThe app was showing the same route to the user before i.e the old response had\nthe same route as the new response. This means that the driver is following the\noriginal route that we determined.\n\nIn this case, we need to animate the driver marker on the map from the old\nlocation to the new location along the same route. This is the most common\nscenario, which can again be broken down further into multiple scenarios (yeah,\nI’m all about breaking things down 🤐).\n\n3.1: Does the new location lie on the route?\nTo animate the driver marker from it’s current position to the new location, we\nfirst need to know whether the new location lies on the route or not.\n\nYeah, we can’t be sure that the driver location that we have received would\nalways lie on the route/road because of various GPS inaccuracy issues.\n\nWe iterate through every segment in the route to find the segment which has the\nnew location. For every segment, we use the Geometry/PolyUtil library to\ndetermine whether the driver location lies on that route.\n\nWe also specify a tolerance of a few meters to account for GPS inaccuracy. So,\nif the newly received location is within a radius of X meters near a segment,\nthis method will return true.\n\nAndroid\n\nboolean isLocationOnPath(LatLng point,List<LatLng> polyline,boolean geodesic,\ndouble tolerance)\n\niOS\n\nBOOL GMSGeometryIsLocationOnPathToleranc\n[https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios-sdk/reference/group___geometry_utils#ga580ba381b9d4fbc0ff430cf69e06e66d]\ne(CLLocationCoordinate2D point,GMSPath\n[https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios-sdk/reference/interface_g_m_s_path] \n* path,BOOL geodesic,CLLocationDistance tolerance)\n\nIf the location doesn’t lie on any of the segments in the route, we are sad and\nso, we don’t animate anything. But if it does, we go forward with the next step\nwhich is….\n\n3.2: Vehicle projection on route\nWhen we receive a new location, the start location is simply the position that\nthe driver marker is already at. No logic required there to calculate that.\n\nThe end location should simply be the new location that we received. Well, in an\nideal world, it should be but we live so far away from an ideal world 😞.\n\nAs we mentioned earlier, the raw driver location that we get from the driver app\nvia GPS/other providers mostly doesn’t lie on the road. So, we have to find a\nprojection of the driver location on the road/route.\n\nIf you have been reading carefully, you might wonder why we can’t just use the \nisLocationOnPath() method above 🤔.\n\nWell, if you had been reading more carefully, you might have noticed that this\nmethod returns a boolean explaining whether the location is on/near the route or\nnot 🤦‍♂. It doesn’t return the projected location. (Ohh..if someone from Maps\nUtils stumbled upon this by chance, please add that method, good sir).\n\nSo, we had to revise some maths. Yeah, folks, learn your maths well. You never\nknow when a situation like this might arise 🤷‍♂.\n\n“Find the projection of point (x,y) on the line y = mx + c”. Does that ring a\nbell? Drawing a perpendicular line towards the segment and calculating the\nlocation of where the line and route intersect can give us the projected\nlocation. Right?\n\nWell, the above approach works for 2-D systems but earth is not a 2-D space. We\nneed a way to project the spherical surface of the earth onto a rectangle 2-D\nspace. There are several ways to do that. All of them have certain drawbacks. We\nmight lose information like direction or the shape of landmasses/countries or\nthe area information.\n\nMercator Projection\n\nMercator projection is one of the available methods to project the spherical map\nof earth onto a rectangle to make usable maps. Most of the mapping tools used\nfor navigation use this projection.\n\nThe key feature of Mercator projection is that it retains the direction\ninformation. That means if point A is 30deg east from north of point B on the\nglobe, it will be in the same direction on its Mercator projection. Or say there\nis a turn of 90deg in some lane, it will be 90deg on Mercator projection as\nwell. That is the reason it works really well for navigation purposes.\n\nHow to use a Mercator projection?\n\n 1. Every point on the earth is projected on a cylinder exactly like point A\n    which has point A’ on the cylinder.\n 2. Once all the required points/routes are projected on this cylinder. It is\n    unrolled, and we obtain a rectangle like the one shown above.\n 3. All the planar geometry can be applied with a very little margin of error on\n    this 2D projected map.\n 4. After processing all the points/routes they can be converted back to\n    latitude and longitude on the globe.\n\nSo, now we have the projected driver location on the route which we will fondly\ncall snapped point going forward.\n\n3.3: End-to-End animation\nThe new driver location that we receive can be present in any segment. It may be\nthat it is in the same segment or it may be that it is on the next segment or on\nthe next one or it may be that it is on the last segment.\n\nBut for linear animation, we need a start point and an end point. The start\npoint is the current position of the driver marker. We already got the snapped\nendpoint in the earlier section. But we can’t just animate from start to end at\nonce as that would seem like the car is flying and ignoring U-turns, routes,\netc. So, how do we prevent it from flying?\n\nWhat do you do when you can’t fly to a place? You follow the road. Right? That’s\nwhat we have to do as well. Make the driver marker follow the route/road. We\nneed to animate along each segment in the route until we reach the segment which\nhas the driver position that we received.\n\nThere are again two cases here 😜:\n\n3.3.1: The new driver location is on the same segment\nIn this case, we can directly animate from the current position of driver marker\nto the driver location that we received since this is just a straight line\nanimation.\n\nA segment is always a straight line. We will discuss more on how to do the\nanimation b/w 2 points in a later section.\n\n3.3.2: The new driver location is on a different segment\nIn this case, we need to animate to that segment along the route. We have to\nanimate along each of the segments in between to reach the final segment.\n\nFor animation along the first segment, we set the endpoint of the animation to\nthe beginning of the next segment in the route. We animate to the end of the\nfirst segment.\n\nThe next segment may also not have the driver location that we received. After a\ndriver has traversed the first segment, we move the end location of the\nanimation to the end of the next segment, and so on and so forth till we reach\nthe last segment. Confusing, ya? Let’s see an example.\n\nSo much zig-zag (huh!!)The car icon(A) represents the location in the segment\nwhere the driver marker currently is. The red pin(X) represents the new snapped\nlocation received.\n\nIn the 1st animation, we move the driver marker from A to the end of the first\nsegment (B).\n\nIn the 2nd animation, the driver marker is moved through the entire length of\nthe 2nd segment.\n\nAnd so on and so forth till we reach the segment which has the newly received\nsnapped location (X).\n\nAnimation in a segment\nWe now know how the overall animation would look like. But we also need to\nconfigure how the smallest unit of the animation i.e animation in a segment\nshould happen.\n\nStart point and End point: For case #1 above, the animation in a segment will\nhappen just once. For case #2 above, this animation in a segment will happen\nmultiple times. Start and endpoints will be determined before beginning each of\nthe animations.\n\nBearing b/w these two points: Bearing can be calculated using another one of\nGeometry/Maps Utils method.\n\nSphericalUtil.computeHeading(startPosition, endPosition)\n\nDuration of animation: Calculating duration is a bit tricky. And the duration is\nthe most important thing in any animation. Sometimes the difference b/w a smooth\nand a choppy animation is caused by the duration. It was very important that we\ngot it right. So, let’s take a break and see how to calculate the duration.\n\nWhat is Duration?\nIt’s the amount of time for which the animation should happen. But you already\nknow that. Going back to middle school maths (yeah, that far), how do you\ncalculate time? Time is nothing but distance divided by speed. Correct?\nCalculating straight line distance b/w the two points we want to animate through\nis pretty easy.\n\nSphericalUtil.computeDistanceBetween(startLocation, endLocation)\n\nCool, cool. But what about speed? How should we calculate speed?\n\nSpeed calculation\nFusedLocationProvider API in the driver app does provide the speed of the\nvehicle but it’s highly unreliable. So, we have to employ some tricks to\ncalculate the speed.\n\nSpeed is distance divided by time. Distance again!! Seems like we are running in\ncircles 😵. Not exactly. Here the distance is not the straight line distance b/w\nthe two points that we have to animate through.\n\nThis is the total distance along the route from the segment that the old driver\nlocation is currently located at, to the segment where the new driver location\nis. Yeah, that statement is a bit confusing. So, let’s take an example.\n\nThe car icon(A) represents the location in the segment where the driver marker\ncurrently is. The red pin(X) represents the new snapped location received. To\ncalculate the distance, we do the obvious:\n\nTotal distance = d1 + d2 + d3 + d4\n\nNow, we have the distance. We need the time interval.\n\nThe FusedLocationProvider API in the driver app does provide us the timestamp at\nwhich a location was updated. And this information is passed to our backend and\nsubsequently to the customer app.\n\nWe calculate the time difference b/w the old driver location and the new driver\nlocation using their timestamps. Wait, how do we know the old driver location?\nAs we had mentioned earlier, we cache the last available driver location and\nroute in an in-memory cache.\n\nTotal route distance divided by time and now we have the speed for the entire\nduration. Linear distance divided by this speed and now we have the durationfor\na single animation in a segment. Cool, so let’s get back to the point where we\nbroke off 😅.\n\nUpdate the animation\nWith all the above information, we start the animation. But wait? Aren’t we\nmissing something? We did start an animation b/w two points but how will our\nanimator know how to animate?\n\nAnimation is just a bunch of frame updates that happen every fast. How do we\nupdate the marker position, the starting point of the route, the rotation in\neach and every frame of the animation? Well, the mobile/web framework allows us\nto do something every time the frame is updated.\n\nBut what is this something that we should do?\n\n1. Update marker’s position\nFor markers, we need to update their position. Once we have the position, we can\nsimply update the marker position using the marker.setPosition(). To find the\nposition during each frame of the animation, we need the percentage of animation\nthat has elapsed.\n\nWe can get the percentage from the Animation framework. Using this percentage\nand the start and end position, we calculate the intermediate position/s like\nthis:\n\nSphericalUtil.interpolate(startPosition, endPosition, fraction)\n\n2. Update Routes\nRoutes need to be aligned with the marker’s movement. So, we update the routes\nas well using the values above and updating the polyline points of that route\nusing the polyline.setPoints().\n\nAnd that’s a wrap. The result that we get is a very smooth, measured movement of\nthe vehicle along the road.\n\nThere are a few more tips/tricks that we employ to ensure that there are no\nabrupt changes in the animation.\n\nBut that’s for next time. 😃\n\nWhat’s next?\nWe still need to go a long way to meet the standards that we have set for\nourselves. Currently, this new experience is only rolled out to GoRide, GoCar,\nand GoBluebird. We are working on bringing the same experience to other services\nlike GoFood, GoSend, and GoShop.

Voila!! You got a driver. That was fast. You can see your driver’s location on the map, and the estimated time they would take to come to you.</p><p><em><em>But hang on… It seems like the map is a bit messed up.</em></em></p><p>The driver location on the map goes back and forth at unreal speed, and even flies over buildings. Starring in an action movie is not exactly how you want to start your week. 😮</p><p>While our driver-partners sure are superman in their own unique way, they certainly can’t drive over buildings. This is clearly not how your driver is actually driving on the road. But then why is the map showing all this?</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://gojek-ghost.zysk.in/content/images/2020/05/LiveTracking2.gif\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>Well, there are multiple factors that can lead to a bad experience like that. Some within our control, some not so much (as of now). We decided to go back to the drawing board and figure out the issues that are in our control and fix them for good. And that is how we built a world-class (arguably 😬) live-tracking experience.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://gojek-ghost.zysk.in/content/images/2020/05/image.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>But what is live-tracking, you would ask?</p><p>Live tracking is a complete map experience. It doesn’t involve anything other than what you see on maps after you get a driver.</p><p>So, what do you see on maps?</p><ol><li>Driver's location depicted by a green marker.</li><li>The routes.</li><li>The change in driver marker as the driver moves closer to your pickup/your destination.</li><li>The change in route as the driver moves.</li></ol><p>And that’s it. That’s all live-tracking is.</p><blockquote><em><em>But that sounds quite simple. Right? Use some routing APIs and plot the markers and routes.</em></em></blockquote><p>Well, yes, it sounded easy to us when we first heard about it too. The real experience threw us a few curveballs. Let’s go through how we create a live-tracking experience.</p><h3 id=\"input\">Input</h3><p>Let’s look at the input data that we need to create a live-tracking animation:</p><h3 id=\"driver-location-and-routes\">Driver Location and Routes</h3><p>Our driver apps have an in-built mechanism to upload driver location to our backend at regular intervals. This is how we are able to find a driver close to your location when you order one of our services. The primary input to live-tracking is this driver location.</p><p>In our driver app, we get this location using Android’s <code>FusedLocationProvider</code> API which automatically uses the best location provider(GPS, Wifi, etc). The driver location is ingested into our backend system via a continuous stream. Routes are generated by our internal routing engine and provided to the customer app.</p><h3 id=\"input-source\">Input Source</h3><p>As you would have guessed, this data is provided via API calls initiated by the our Super App to the routing engine.</p><p>Making the API call just once won’t be sufficient. Right? The app needs to be informed every time the driver’s location has changed. So, the customer app polls this API every few seconds to get this data.</p><p>Now, we have a continuous stream of data flowing to our app which has all the information that we need to show the vehicle animation on the road.</p><h3 id=\"terminology\">Terminology</h3><p>Before moving forward, we should get acquainted with a few terminologies that we would use quite frequently in this post.</p><ol><li><strong><strong>Route</strong></strong>: The entire list of latitude-longitudes between the driver location to the pickup/destination location.</li><li><strong><strong>Segment</strong></strong>: A segment is the smallest unit of a route. It is a straight line from one position in the routes list to the very next position in the routes list.</li></ol><p>A route of length n has n-1 segments. Confused? Yeah, let’s take an example.</p><p>A <strong><strong>Route</strong></strong> looks like this:</p><p>[{-6<code>2441198, 106.8032959},<br>{-6.2440766, 106.80328}, <br>{-6.2439977, 106.8033275},<br>{-6.2434893, 106.8029214},<br>{-6.2433926, 106.8030539},<br>{-6.2436018, 106.803222}]</code></p><p>There are 5 <strong><strong>Segments</strong></strong> in this route.</p><p><code>Segment 1: {-6.2441198, 106.8032959,-6.2440766, 106.80328}</code><br><code>Segment 2: {-6.2440766, 106.80328,-6.2439977, 106.8033275}</code><br><code>Segment 3: {-6.2439977, 106.8033275,-6.2434893, 106.8029214}</code><br><code>Segment 4: {-6.2434893, 106.8029214,-6.2433926, 106.8030539}</code><br><code>Segment 5: {-6.2433926, 106.8030539,-6.2436018, 106.8032224}</code></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://gojek-ghost.zysk.in/content/images/2020/05/image-1.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><h3 id=\"the-initial-setup\">The initial setup</h3><p>When the user lands on the live tracking screen, the app immediately makes a call to our internal API to get the driver location and route. Once we get this data, we plot it on the map using the standard GoogleMap methods. <code><em><em>googleMap.addMarker()</em></em></code><em><em>, </em></em><code><em><em>googleMap.addPolyline()</em></em></code> etc.</p><p>Sometimes, we don’t have the routing information available immediately, so we just show the driver marker. We also store this data locally in an in-memory cache as we would need it later to do some comparisons.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/436/1*k9IpgQ4ss-bhKHBY5ETUgg.gif\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>So, the customer is able to see the markers and routes on the map now. So far so good.</p><h3 id=\"the-subsequent-updates\">The subsequent updates</h3><p>As I mentioned earlier, we need to change the position of driver marker and route as the driver moves. The customer app makes a call to the same internal API every few seconds. After the first response, we don’t move any markers or routes on the map until the next response succeeds.</p><p>In the next response, we again get the same data points i.e the route and driver location but with different values, of course, <strong><strong>if the driver has moved</strong></strong>. The next set of data that we get can have the following characteristics:</p><ol><li>Route and driver location don’t change</li><li>Route changes</li><li>Route doesn’t change BUT driver location does</li></ol><p>Let’s discuss these cases one by one.</p><h3 id=\"1-route-and-driver-location-don-t-change\">1: Route and driver location don’t change</h3><p>If nothing has changed, we don’t need to do anything. Probably our driver partner is stuck in traffic. 😞</p><h3 id=\"2-route-changes\">2: Route changes</h3><p>This can happen either when:</p><ol><li>The app was not showing any route to the user before i.e the first response didn’t have the route.</li><li>The app was showing a route that is different from the newly received route. This usually happens in cases where the driver starts following a different route from the one they were following before. This can also happen due to road closures or simply because our driver-partner initially followed a wrong route by mistake 😅.</li></ol><p>In either of these cases, we simply ignore the old driver marker and routes which were shown and plot the new marker and routes.</p><h3 id=\"3-route-doesn-t-change-but-driver-location-does\">3: Route doesn’t change BUT driver location does</h3><p>The app was showing the same route to the user before i.e the old response had the same route as the new response. This means that the driver is following the original route that we determined.</p><p>In this case, we need to animate the driver marker on the map from the old location to the new location along the same route. This is the most common scenario, which can again be broken down further into multiple scenarios (yeah, I’m all about breaking things down 🤐).</p><h3 id=\"3-1-does-the-new-location-lie-on-the-route\">3.1: Does the new location lie on the route?</h3><p>To animate the driver marker from it’s current position to the new location, we first need to know whether the new location lies on the route or not.</p><p>Yeah, we can’t be sure that the driver location that we have received would always lie on the route/road because of various GPS inaccuracy issues.</p><p>We iterate through every segment in the route to find the segment which has the new location. For every segment, we use the Geometry/PolyUtil library to determine whether the driver location lies on that route.</p><p>We also specify a tolerance of a few meters to account for GPS inaccuracy. So, if the newly received location is within a radius of <strong><strong>X meters</strong></strong> near a segment, this method will return true.</p><p><strong><strong>Android</strong></strong></p><p><code>boolean isLocationOnPath(LatLng point,List&lt;LatLng&gt; polyline,boolean geodesic, double tolerance)</code></p><p><strong><strong>iOS</strong></strong></p><p><code>BOOL <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios-sdk/reference/group___geometry_utils#ga580ba381b9d4fbc0ff430cf69e06e66d\" rel=\"noopener\">GMSGeometryIsLocationOnPathToleranc</a>e(CLLocationCoordinate2D point,<a href=\"https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios-sdk/reference/interface_g_m_s_path\" rel=\"noopener\">GMSPath</a> * path,BOOL geodesic,CLLocationDistance tolerance)</code></p><p>If the location doesn’t lie on any of the segments in the route, we are sad and so, we don’t animate anything. But if it does, we go forward with the next step which is….</p><h3 id=\"3-2-vehicle-projection-on-route\">3.2: Vehicle projection on route</h3><p>When we receive a new location, the start location is simply the position that the driver marker is already at. No logic required there to calculate that.</p><p>The end location should simply be the new location that we received. Well, in an ideal world, it <strong><strong>should be</strong></strong> but we live so far away from an ideal world 😞.</p><p>As we mentioned earlier, the raw driver location that we get from the driver app via GPS/other providers mostly doesn’t lie on the road. So, we have to find a projection of the driver location on the road/route.</p><p>If you have been reading carefully, you might wonder why we can’t just use the <em><em>isLocationOnPath()</em></em> method above 🤔.</p><p>Well, if you had been reading <em><em>more</em></em> carefully, you might have noticed that this method returns a boolean explaining whether the location is on/near the route or not 🤦‍♂. It doesn’t return the projected location. (Ohh..if someone from Maps Utils stumbled upon this by chance, please add that method, good sir).</p><p>So, we had to revise some maths. Yeah, folks, learn your maths well. You never know when a situation like this might arise 🤷‍♂.</p><p><em><em>“Find the projection of point (x,y) on the line y = mx + c”.</em></em> Does that ring a bell? Drawing a perpendicular line towards the segment and calculating the location of where the line and route intersect can give us the projected location. Right?</p><p>Well, the above approach works for 2-D systems but earth is not a 2-D space. We need a way to project the spherical surface of the earth onto a rectangle 2-D space. There are several ways to do that. All of them have certain drawbacks. We might lose information like direction or the shape of landmasses/countries or the area information.</p><p><strong><strong>Mercator Projection</strong></strong></p><p>Mercator projection is one of the available methods to project the spherical map of earth onto a rectangle to make usable maps. Most of the mapping tools used for navigation use this projection.</p><p>The key feature of Mercator projection is that it retains the direction information. That means if point A is 30deg east from north of point B on the globe, it will be in the same direction on its Mercator projection. Or say there is a turn of 90deg in some lane, it will be 90deg on Mercator projection as well. That is the reason it works really well for navigation purposes.</p><p><strong><strong>How to use a Mercator projection?</strong></strong></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://gojek-ghost.zysk.in/content/images/2020/05/image-4.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://gojek-ghost.zysk.in/content/images/2020/05/image-5.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><ol><li>Every point on the earth is projected on a cylinder exactly like point A which has point A’ on the cylinder.</li><li>Once all the required points/routes are projected on this cylinder.

It may be that it is in the same segment or it may be that it is on the next segment or on the next one or it may be that it is on the last segment.</p><p>But for linear animation, we need a start point and an end point. The start point is the current position of the driver marker. We already got the snapped endpoint in the earlier section. But we can’t just animate from start to end <strong><strong>at once</strong></strong> as that would seem like the car is flying and ignoring U-turns, routes, etc. So, how do we prevent it from flying?</p><p>What do you do when you can’t fly to a place? You follow the road. Right? That’s what we have to do as well. Make the driver marker follow the route/road. We need to animate along each segment in the route until we reach the segment which has the driver position that we received.</p><p>There are again two cases here 😜:</p><h3 id=\"3-3-1-the-new-driver-location-is-on-the-same-segment\">3.3.1: The new driver location is on the same segment</h3><p>In this case, we can directly animate from the current position of driver marker to the driver location that we received since this is just a straight line animation.</p><p>A segment is always a straight line.

After the programming language, a very important component for the\ndev workflow is a good IDE.\n\nPurists generally rave about the use of Editors like Sublime, VSCode or even use\nof Vim/Emacs over full-fledged IDE’s like Jetbrains IntelliJ, Pycharm or\nEclipse. However, the truth is most modern devs in this day and age use/prefer\nIDE’s for the host of convenience features, speed, and flexibility they provide.\n\nPersonally, I am a big fan of IDE’s provided by Jetbrains\n[https://www.jetbrains.com/], and they are generally my tools of choice—saving\nme a ton of time while performing refactoring and greatly decreasing development\ntime.\n\n> Not convinced yet?\nIf you’ve used IntelliJ, then ppen up IntelliJ > Help > Productivity Guide and\nsee how much time it has saved you.\n\nThis is my breakdown in the past two years:\n\nHowever,\n\n * Do we really extract the maximum juice out of these tools?\n * How many of the IDE’s features do we really use on a day-to-day basis?\n\nWell, fret not. This post will share some awesome tips that you can also follow\nto become more productive with your editors. I got to know some of these\nfeatures when the prolific Dev evangelist Hadi Hariri [https://hadihariri.com/] \nfrom Jetbrains visited Gojek [https://www.gojek.io/] Bengaluru and shared these\nduring a meetup.\n\nTo demonstrate these features, I would be using appium Java client\n[https://github.com/appium/java-client] project but the same features can be\napplied in any Java/Kotlin (IntelliJ IDEA) project of your choice or Python\nproject (In Pycharm).\n\nIdeavim\nTo start with, did you know all Jetbrains editors come with a very good VIM\nsupport via IdeaVim plugin? Vim commands are amazing.\n\nOnce you get used to them, your editing and code navigation speed is easily\nmultiplied 2X and it’s so easy to use it within IntelliJ. If you want to know\nVIM basics, I wrote a post\n[https://automationhacks.blog/2018/09/23/vim-the-editor-you-need-but-not-the-one-you-deserve/] \non it some time back.\n\nTo install this plugin, either opt for it when freshly installing IntelliJ or Go\nto preferences > Plugins and search for IdeaVim in marketplace, don't worry, you\ncan always temporarily disable it and practice first before starting to use it\nin your day to day workflow.\n\nThe most common commands that you should be aware of are mentioned right when\nyou open it.\n\nI use the IntelliJ IDEA classic keybindings, however, you should be able to\nquickly find the short cuts for these operations in the binding of your choice ( \nLook into Preferences > Keymap)\n\nSearch Shortcuts\nDouble Shift brings up the search console and this is the single place to either\n\n * Search Classes or Files (Shift + Cmd + N): with certain names in your project\n   or\n * Perform any action (Shift + Cmd + A): for example, refactoring certain\n   components inside a class\n\nYou can also easily learn the keyboard shortcuts for the common operations\nwithin the editor by seeing the shortcut right beside the command on this\nscreen. Trust me, the investment in learning these has huge payoffs.\n\n> The number of times that you avoid using the trackpad or mouse is one time less \nthat you have to context switch while coding. Believe me, that makes a\ndifference.\nSearch by file initials\nWhile trying to find a file, often we just know the name vaguely by memory. In\nSearch, it is sufficient to just mention the initials of the file and IntelliJ\nwill list out all the files which match that criteria\n\nLet’s say, for example, I want to search for all test files which start with A \nand have Test suffix, I can just enter ATes and see all the file names which\nmatch this.\n\nSearch method inside a file matching a pattern\nWhat if I want to search for all methods having find keyword inside test files\nnamed AndTes?\n\nWell you just use a dot . in these search queries and you can easily search for\neven methods inside classes based on partial pattern search.\n\nIn this case, AndTest.find would show all the methods with find keyword in them.\nNeat huh?\n\nSearch for file names inside a particular folder\nIn the example below, I am searching for file names starting with KeyE under \nnativekey folder by separating them with a forward slash /\n\nnativekey/KeyE\n\nNavigating options all within the search\nIf you type a forward slash / in the search bar, you can see different IDE\nactions that you can take right there.\n\nFind usages\nYou can quickly find out usages of a given function, class, interface, etc by\nhitting Cmd + B, This saves a ton of time over manually searching for code. You\ncan either navigate right inside the result pop up or open it in dedicated\nwindow by selecting Open in find window.\n\nWhat if I want to see all the classes and methods that are present in \nAndroidTest.java class?\n\nWe can open the Structure tab (Cmd + 7) and glance at all the available methods\nwith options to even show anonymous classes/lambdas inside the class.\n\nNow, this could be very useful when you have a long class and want to see all\nthe methods and then quickly navigate to them. Too many methods might hint at a\npotential refactoring candidate.\n\nSwitcher\nTo switch between open files and open tabs\n\nUse Ctrl + Tab and then to move down continue pressing Ctrl + Tab and to move up\nin switcher use Ctrl + Shift + Tab\n\nThis is a useful way to quickly navigate among files and menu options again\nwithout using mouse or trackpad\n\nRecent files\nYou do not need to remember what files were recently opened. To view recent\nfiles accessed, execute Cmd + E\n\nNavigation bar\nHow many times have you switched the project tree using Cmd + 1 and gone one\nlevel up to open a file? Before observing this, I know I kept on doing this\nagain and again.\n\nHowever, IntelliJ has a navigation bar on top of the editor which can be used to\nvery quickly navigate up the project tree.\n\nLive templates\nIntelliJ has a bunch of templates already created which can be quickly used to\ncreate a base skeleton code for many common constructs.\n\nIt is also aware of what type of file is currently opened and can show available\noptions by opening Cmd + J, once you select the one that you are looking for,\nexpand this code using Tab key\n\nTo open these templates and maybe even add your own, open Preferences > Editor >\nLive Templates\n\nInject language reference\nIntelliJ allows us to insert the context of a particular language and allows to\nwork with it within another file. Seems confusing? Let me explain why this is a\nsuper neat feature.\n\nLet’s assume you want to store JSON string inside a Java file. Typically Java 8\ndoes not have support for multi-line string (Added in Java 12 though\n[https://dzone.com/articles/jdk-12-raw-string-literals])\n\nYou can start with a simple string variable. Press Option + Enter and select \nInject language or reference\n\nAnd then select the file type. Let’s say JSON\n\nNow that we have provided the context, You can again press Option + Enter and\nthen select Edit JSON fragment . This opens up a new window where you can create\nand edit JSON freely and the corresponding concatenated string is automagically\ninserted.\n\nValidate regex inside the editor\nRegexes are a very powerful concept to learn and use. How many times have you\nhad to write small scratch files (or use regex sites [https://regexr.com/]) with\nbelow snippet to test whether a given string matches a regex?\n\nI have personally done this many times.\n\nclass Scratch {\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\nString regex = \"\\w+ world!\";\nString testString = \"Hello world!\";\nSystem.out.println(testString.matches(regex));\n}\n}\n\nIntelliJ makes this even easier. Given a regex, enter Option + Enter and select \nCheck RegExp\n\nEnter test strings and IntelliJ would automatically test whether the sample\nstring is a match or not. Neat right?\n\nDrop frames while debugging\nWhile developing it’s very important to be good at debugging. IntelliJ allows a\nvery rich set of inspection features to know the state of variables/classes at a\ngiven point in the code.\n\nIn this below example, we have a simple fooBar() method which is a wrapper over \nfoo and bar methods where foo has a debug point.\n\nWhat if we want to move a step back from the current frame? It turns out we can\nselect the current frame and select Drop frame and that would move the debug\nflow back to foo method.\n\nIt’s amazing how much time this saves since we do not need to rewire the\ndebugging session from scratch.\n\nHopefully, this post encouraged you to also explore the feature-rich IDEs that\nJetbrains provides, and give your automation development a literal nitro boost.\n(NFS reference anyone? 😋)\n\nWhat other IDE tricks have been lifesavers for you? Let me know in the comments.\nIf you found this useful, do share it with a friend or colleague.\n\nFor more such stories sent to your inbox once a week, sign up for our\nnewsletter!

This allows users to have\nconversations with:\n\n * The currently assigned driver partner in relation to a booking.\n * Other Gojek users, provided they are known contacts in your address book.\n   These can be either personal or group chats.\n\nIn order to use the chat platform as springboard to other services within\nGojek’s vast ecosystem, we wanted to expose some features that integrate with\nour other offerings — within the convenience of a chat window.\n\nOne of the first service options we wanted to focus on was payments — paying and\nrequesting for money between individuals and groups. Chat had the platform to\ncreate connections between people, GoPay had payments — it was time to marry the\ntwo.\n\nArchitecture\nTo start with, as a chat platform team, we did not really know anything about\nthe payments domain. In fact, most of the integrations we planned for required\ncollaborating with other product teams within Gojek.\n\nWe decided early on that we needed a plugin-based framework that other product\nteams (and even chat team’s core services) could use. We also decided that the\nAPI surface area for this new framework should have as much as possible in\ncommon between the Android and iOS implementations.\n\nThe first use case we focused on was integrating payment options within chat —\nwhich would help us kickstart our design and feature rollout.\n\nApproach\nIn the vein of keeping things as simple as possible, we came up with the\nfollowing set of guidelines:\n\n * The chat subsystem can expose add-on features to the user\n * These features will not be part of the core chat offering, but can be\n   plugged-in externally\n * These plugin-based entities — chat extensions — can have mainly two\n   capabilities\n * Display a button (widget) in a chat window to trigger the chat extension’s\n   functionality\n * Display chat extension messages that can support rich text, images,\n   call-to-actions\n\nChat extension messages are merely text messages with additional metadata. While\nplain text-based messages are rendered by the core chat rendering system, chat\nextension messages need to be rendered by the chat extension that created the\nmessage.\n\nChat Extension Framework — Key ActorsThe illustration above depicts the final\nframework components we came up with.\n\n * Chat Extension Providers are responsible for vending Chat Extensions based on\n   the active Chat Session (there might be cases where we want to enable a\n   certain feature only for certain types of chats e.g. those between our\n   drivers and customers).\n * Chat Extensions are the components responsible for vending trigger points (\n   Widget Views) and custom message views (Extension Message Views).\n\nWhile the core subsystem takes care of managing life cycles of the chat\nextensions, widgets, and message views, it is the responsibility of extension\nauthors to purely focus on the implementation details of their feature.\n\nWith the above design in place, we were ready to start collaborating and start\nimplementing features.\n\nLet’s take a look at some integrations we were able to build collaboratively.\n\nSample Integrations\nPayments\nThe first integration we did was Request and Pay flows. Utilising GoPay,\ncustomers can make payments and request for money from friends.\n\nHere’s the Request Flow in action, within a personal chat:\n\nRequest Money from an IndividualIn a group chat, Request Flow translates to a\nSplit Bill flow:\n\nRequest Money in a GroupHere’s the Pay flow in action:\n\nPay via GoPay, continue conversation in ChatIn the Pay Flow, we start with\nmaking a payment from the home-screen of the Gojek App. Once a payment is done,\nyou have an option to continue to chat with the person you made the payment to.\nThis flow is of course in addition to similar flows for Request where you can\ntrigger a payment within chat itself.\n\nThe payments team were able to create a UX flow that could be triggered either\nfrom the home screen or the chat window.\n\nRestaurant Sharing\nNext up, our GoFood team wanted to explore sharing restaurant information via\nchat. Since we already had support for extensions at this point in time, we\ncreated a generic Share Via Chat flow that supports sharing simple text messages\nor custom extension message content.\n\nIn the Pay Flow, we start with making a payment from the home-screen of the\nGojek App. Once a payment is done, you have an option to continue to chat with\nthe person you made the payment to. This flow is of course in addition to\nsimilar flows for Request where you can trigger a payment within chat itself.\n\nThe payments team were able to create a UX flow that could be triggered either\nfrom the home screen or the chat window.\n\nRestaurant Sharing\nNext up, our GoFood team wanted to explore sharing restaurant information via\nchat. Since we already had support for extensions at this point in time, we\ncreated a generic Share Via Chat flow that supports sharing simple text messages\nor custom extension message content.\n\n\nShare Restaurant Details via ChatWhat’s interesting is that once a Restaurant\nCard has been shared via chat, a recipient clicking on that card can proceed to\nmake a food order, directly from the chat window itself. This is made possible\nby the fact that Extension Message Views can be fully interactive (e.g. detect\nuser taps), and the chat window provides contextual navigation controls to them.\n\nImage Sharing\nLastly, let us take a look at the most recent feature we rolled out to\nproduction — image sharing in our customer-driver chats.\n\nImage Sharing via ChatDuring the implementation of this feature, we recognised\nthat image sharing would be better triggered from the chat window if there was a\ndirect shortcut button (e.g. a camera icon) within the bottom text input area of\nthe chat window.\n\nThis leads us to enhance our extension framework to allow Chat Extensions to\nprovide Chat Extension Shortcuts as well. Our updated framework looks like\nbelow:\n\nLessons Learned\nIt has been a great journey so far exploring various kinds of integrations in a\nsimple chat window. We have a lot more planned, but in the meanwhile, here are a\nfew key things we learned along the way\n\n * When you are developing a platform, evangelising what your platform provides\n   is key. This is equally relevant if you are a platform-product company, or a\n   platform team within a company. We conducted an internal chat extension\n   hackathon which helped broaden our outreach, and saw some pretty cool ideas\n   implemented including Live Location Sharing, Booking Sharing, Games, Sticker\n   Packs etc.\n * Document your public API! Teams are more willing to collaborate if you have\n   proper, up-to-date documentation in place. We created detailed technical\n   documents, integration guides, and even provided a sample chat extension (a\n   starter-pack, if you will) — these greatly helped teams adopting these new\n   features. Also, the feedback we got during the internal hackathon fed\n   directly back into improving our documentation.\n * Having a common design language helped our Android and iOS engineers to\n   collaborate more closely. It was easier for the team to work on implementing\n   the feature by focussing on the common characteristics during tech\n   discussion, design ratification sessions etc. and leaving the nuances of each\n   platform to respective teams during development. Having a common language\n   that engineers can speak (irrespective of their specialisations) improves\n   cross-communications and collaboration.\n * It is important to design solutions exercising self-imposed constraints.\n   These constraints should directly limit the engineering scope of the\n   solution. As engineers, we are all too comfortable going down the technical\n   analysis rabbit-hole in our pursuit of coming up with a well rounded, albeit\n   (possibly) over-engineered solution. This usually ends up in complicated\n   designs, which translate into complicated code. It is better to design\n   simpler systems and iteratively add smaller features, where each iteration\n   cycle should also incorporate refactoring every step of the way. Even though\n   we knew having something like Extension Shortcuts was nice to have from the\n   get go, we had to exercise restraint and only implemented the feature when it\n   was actually required.\n * We cannot stress this enough, but continuous refactoring (whenever required)\n   is one surefire way to reduce the build-up of tech debt in any codebase.\n   Improve a function here, rename a variable there, refactor a class into two —\n   every little bit helps. It is the responsibility of the entire team to be\n   engaged in this exercise.\n\nSo there you have it, a quick look at the way the core chat team developed a\nbase extension framework that is currently being used to build richer\nintegrations into chat.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWant more where that come from?

Since we built it, the adoption of Litmus across Gojek\nteams has been steadily increasing. More experiments are executed and more\nclients (in this case, Gojek teams) are integrated.\n\nBesides this, another requirement is to integrate Litmus with other backend\nservices directly, instead of solely with the mobile app. However, various\nclient backend services have their own SLA and most of them are linked to\nlatency. So, in order to client requirements, we have to reduce Litmus latency\nas much as possible.\n\nIn this post, we talk about our thought process behind delivering an initial\nsidecar design to achieve this goal,\n\nKnow your enemies\nFirst thing first, we needed to figure out where the bottleneck was. After\ndigging through some data, it turned out 30% of total time in a Litmus API call\nwas dominated by database call, and the number of database calls is ~2000 qps.\n\nBased on this fact, we decided to use cache. Now, we obviously could not use an\nexternal cache like Redis or Memcached. If we used those, we would be adding an\nadditional call. 😑\n\nInstead, we decided to use in-memory cache. Since Litmus was written in Clojure,\nwe went with caffeine cache [https://github.com/ben-manes/caffeine], which is\ngood enough to be used in JVM. We implemented the in-memory cache and the\ndatabase calls dropped from ~2000 qps to ~10 qps. The API latency also dropped\naround 10%.\n\nGood, but Not Good Enough. We Needed More.\nThe implementation of in-memory cache and further tinkering with Litmus\nprocesses would not be enough on their own. Our next approach was to reduce the\nhops between client and Litmus servers.\n\nHow? By moving Litmus server so it is geographically closer to the client?\n\n> Nah, we can do one better.\nWe pulled our Litmus server as close as possible to the backend service client.\nTo achieve this, we used sidecar pattern. We created a Litmus sidecar that\nresides in the same box as the backend service client. A Litmus sidecar can be\nseen as a mini version of the Litmus server that specifically serves the\ndedicated backend service client in the same box (VM).\n\nTweaking the Nuts and Bolts\nTo know how effective the sidecar pattern is, we need to know the base latency\nof Litmus server. We created 10 new active experiments specifically to get the\nbase latency number. With 20 concurrency and 10 request per second, the 99\npercentile was 23.55 ms.\n\nNeed faster API calls? Use gRPC\nWe used gRPC over REST wherever we could in our Litmus sidecar. gRPC also has\nvarious features such as push/pull streaming and client-side load balancing that\ncan be utilised for further enhancement. It’s fun stuff! 😁\n\nHow do we maintain our sidecar without permission to maintain the backend\nservice client box?\nIn Gojek, each team can only have permission to access its own components/boxes.\nIt is not possible (or scalable) to access all our backend service client boxes.\n\nWe could have considered this if we had only two or three clients. However, when\nyou’re building for an organisation of Gojek’s scale with the hope of having all\nteams adopt Litmus in their services, we couldn’t go down this route.\n\nOn the other hand, we still needed the ability to check the health of Litmus\nsidecars in every backend service client and develop a sidecar app that complies\nwith several 12 factor apps [https://12factor.net/] criteria (treat logs as\nevent streams and store config in the environment).\n\nSource\n[https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/24c41d54613afb774bff0a383043f8a47f4d0fd7/a14fb/static/img/consul-services.png]\nWe decided to use Consul for service discovery\n[https://www.consul.io/discovery.html] and key-value config\n[https://www.consul.io/docs/agent/kv.html]. In addition being easy to use and\nhaving a nice dashboard UI, Consul service discovery also supports health\nchecks.\n\nAfter we set up the infra (Consul server, agent, etc), we just needed to add our\nservice definition config along with our litmus sidecar to the backend service\nclient box.

Since we built it, the adoption of Litmus across Gojek teams has been steadily increasing. More experiments are executed and more clients (in this case, Gojek teams) are integrated.</p><p>Besides this, another requirement is to integrate Litmus with other backend services directly, instead of solely with the mobile app. However, various client backend services have their own SLA and most of them are linked to latency. So, in order to client requirements, we have to reduce Litmus latency as much as possible.</p><p>In this post, we talk about our thought process behind delivering an initial sidecar design to achieve this goal,</p><h3 id=\"know-your-enemies\">Know your enemies</h3><p>First thing first, we needed to figure out where the bottleneck was. After digging through some data, it turned out 30% of total time in a Litmus API call was dominated by database call, and the number of database calls is ~2000 qps.</p><p>Based on this fact, we decided to use cache. Now, we obviously could not use an external cache like Redis or Memcached. If we used those, we would be adding an additional call. 😑</p><p>Instead, we decided to use in-memory cache. Since Litmus was written in Clojure, we went with <a href=\"https://github.com/ben-manes/caffeine\" rel=\"noopener\">caffeine cache</a>, which is good enough to be used in JVM. We implemented the in-memory cache and the database calls dropped from ~2000 qps to ~10 qps. The API latency also dropped around 10%.</p><h3 id=\"good-but-not-good-enough-we-needed-more-\">Good, but Not Good Enough. We Needed More.</h3><p>The implementation of in-memory cache and further tinkering with Litmus processes would not be enough on their own. Our next approach was to reduce the hops between client and Litmus servers.</p><p><strong><strong>How? By moving Litmus server so it is geographically closer to the client?</strong></strong></p><blockquote>Nah, we can do one better.</blockquote><p>We pulled our Litmus server as close as possible to the backend service client. To achieve this, we used <strong><strong>sidecar pattern</strong></strong>. We created a Litmus sidecar that resides in the same box as the backend service client. A Litmus sidecar can be seen as a mini version of the Litmus server that specifically serves the dedicated backend service client in the same box (VM).</p><h3 id=\"tweaking-the-nuts-and-bolts\">Tweaking the Nuts and Bolts</h3><p>To know how effective the sidecar pattern is, we need to know the base latency of Litmus server. We created 10 new active experiments specifically to get the base latency number. With 20 concurrency and 10 request per second, the 99 percentile was 23.55 ms.</p><h3 id=\"need-faster-api-calls-use-grpc\">Need faster API calls? Use gRPC</h3><p>We used gRPC over REST wherever we could in our Litmus sidecar. gRPC also has various features such as push/pull streaming and client-side load balancing that can be utilised for further enhancement. It’s fun stuff! 😁</p><h3 id=\"how-do-we-maintain-our-sidecar-without-permission-to-maintain-the-backend-service-client-box\">How do we maintain our sidecar without permission to maintain the backend service client box?</h3><p>In Gojek, each team can only have permission to access its own components/boxes. It is not possible (or scalable) to access all our backend service client boxes.</p><p>We could have considered this if we had only two or three clients. However, when you’re building for an organisation of Gojek’s scale with the hope of having all teams adopt Litmus in their services, we couldn’t go down this route.</p><p>On the other hand, we still needed the ability to check the health of Litmus sidecars in every backend service client and develop a sidecar app that complies with several <a href=\"https://12factor.net/\" rel=\"noopener\">12 factor apps</a> criteria (treat logs as event streams and store config in the environment).</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://gojek-ghost.zysk.in/content/images/2020/05/1_DpUpHDHGgk3d_jXEJYgD-w.png\" class=\"kg-image\"><figcaption><a href=\"https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/24c41d54613afb774bff0a383043f8a47f4d0fd7/a14fb/static/img/consul-services.png\">Source</a></figcaption></figure><p>We decided to use Consul for <a href=\"https://www.consul.io/discovery.html\" rel=\"noopener\">service discovery</a> and <a href=\"https://www.consul.io/docs/agent/kv.html\" rel=\"noopener\">key-value config</a>. In addition being easy to use and having a nice dashboard UI, Consul service discovery also supports health checks.</p><p>After we set up the infra (Consul server, agent, etc), we just needed to add our service definition config along with our litmus sidecar to the backend service client box.

As our previous research has explained, we first perform \nclustering\n[https://blog.gojekengineering.com/fantastic-drivers-and-how-to-find-them-a88239ef3b29] \non historical bookings to form potential pickup points, then we use a language\nmodel\n[https://blog.gojekengineering.com/how-i-met-my-gojek-driver-without-a-single-call-95041f4fdd03] \nto select the best name. Here, we explain how we improved upon the previous\nstatistical language model with a state-of-the-art NLP model, which makes the\nentire naming exercise fully scalable. This is the magic behind all the pickup\npoints seen on the Gojek app.\n\nHow can we learn better?\nAs explained in our previous post, our original statistical language model\nselects the best pickup point name from the most probable n-grams extracted from\nbookings text. However, such a statistical language model doesn’t ‘understand’\nthe meaning of the texts, it simply chooses phrases with high frequencies\nwithout knowing the semantics. Sometimes it throws street names, sometimes even\ncommon phrases with no information about location. We have to manually check\neverything to make sure it reflects the right POI, before it appears on the app.\n\nThis creates a challenge — especially if we want to quickly expand the\nfrictionless pickup experience to customers across in new geographies. Hence, we\ndecided to go a step further with a deep-learning NLP model that ‘understands’\nand ‘learns’ to differentiate what is a valid pickup point name.\n\nAt Gojek, we never stop thinking and always go a step further\n\nMeet CartoBERT ?\nOne of the most recent and impactful breakthroughs NLP was the publication of\nBERT[1] — a contextual language representation with transformer models — by\nGoogle in late 2018. It obtained state-of-the-art results on a wide array of NLP\ntasks. In the 2019, many NLP researches were influenced by BERT, including\nXLNet, RoBERTa, ERNIE etc.\n\nBERT Explained\nBERT, or Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, is composed of\nan embedding layer, followed by groups of transformer layers.\n\nEvery word (token) in the input sentence will first get encoded into its\nembedding representations in the embedding layer, and then go through\nbidirectional transformer encoder layers. Every encoder layer will perform the\nmulti-head attention computation on the token representation from the previous\nlayer to create a new intermediate representation, which is then output to the\nnext layer. The output from the final layer is the contextual representation of\nthe input token. A pooled sentence level representation combining all token\nrepresentations could be created if needed by specific downstream tasks.\n\nWith the final contextual representations at either token or sentence level, a\npre-trained BERT on large unlabelled text corpus, could be further extended to a\nwide variety of NLP tasks, such as text classification, question answering,\nNamed Entity Recognition (NER) etc.\n\nALBERT[2], published by Google in Sep 2019, improved on BERT with embedding\nparameter factorisation and cross layer parameter sharing to reduce the number\nof parameters (by 9 times for base model). It also uses sequence order\nprediction instead of next sentence prediction for the pre-train task. In the\npaper, ALBERT also outperforms BERT on standard NLP tasks/datasets (SQUAD, RACE\netc), with fewer parameters.\n\nPre-train CartoBERT to learn language representation from Gojek bookings text\nInspired by ALBERT’s lightweight model and performance, we developed CartoBERT,\nGojek’s very own pickup point name recognition model, based on ALBERT’s\narchitecture.\n\nAs illustrated below, the uncased CartoBERT is pre-trained on Gojek’s own masked\nbookings text corpus of about 200 million sentences. Booking text is first\npre-processed for data masking to mask all customer sensitive information,\nlanguage detection, text normalisation (including text cleaning, slang,\nabbreviation transformations, lowercase transformation and emoji removal). The\npre-processed text is used to build subword vocabularies which handles\nOut-Of-Vocabulary (OOV) tokens that could be decomposed to frequent subword\npatterns. CartoBERT tokenizer is then created with the subword vocabularies and\nfurther used to encode and tokenize the same preprocessed bookings text to form\npre-trained input files.\n\nSame as ALBERT, the model is pre-trained to ‘understand’ Gojek’s bookings text\nusing Masked Language Model — which predicts randomly masked tokens in input\nsentences — and Sentence Order Prediction tasks, which predicts the order of\ninput sentences pair.\n\nFine-tuning CartoBERT to extract pickup point names from Gojek bookings text\nWith the huge amount of bookings text we have at Gojek, now CartoBERT can better\n‘understand’ past bookings text. Theoretically, it ‘understands’ every word of a\nbooking text sentence.\n\nFor every token in the input sentence, CartoBERT will output a 768-dimension\nvector (we use the default hidden layer size of the ALBERT base model in\nCartoBERT, however this is configurable) from last transformer encoder layer,\nand we use that to represent CartoBERT’s ‘understanding’ of the token’s meaning\nin the sentence context for fine-tune step.\n\nAs illustrated in the diagram below, while fine-tuning CartoBERT for pickup\npoint name recognition, we replace the Masked Language Model and Sequence Order\nPrediction layers from CartoBERT in pre-train step with token classification\nlayer. The token classification layer learns to predict the probability of a\ntoken belonging to a pickup point name, with the final token representation\noutput from CartoBERT transformer layers, from labelled training data created\nwith bookings text sentences, and corresponding pickup point names. Here, we use\nweighted cross entropy loss to deal with class imbalance, as tokens tagged to\npickup point names are a minority.\n\n\n\nWith this, CartoBERT is fine-tuned to extract pickup point names from bookings\ntext sentences, if any.\n\nHow does the model perform?\nCartoBERT gives a lift of more than 25% in pickup point name accuracy to ~93%\naccuracy, which is measured as the percentage of valid pick up point names out\nof generated names. With this high accuracy, we have achieved full scalability\nof automatic generation for named pickup points to quickly cover multiple\ngeographies without heavy reliance on human inputs.\n\nWhat’s next?\nWe are not stopping here and are exploring using active learning to further\nimprove CartoBERT. With active learning, we only flag out uncertain predictions,\nwhich are measured as sentence level least token probability[3] for human\nlabelling. We then use human-curated data as feedback for model learning. In\nthis way, we can improve model learning efficiency with minimum labelling\neffort.\n\nWhat’s more, with the success of CartoBERT, we are considering pre-training and\nopen sourcing a general Indonesia Bahasa ALBERT model with Indonesia open corpus\nfrom wiki, news, Twitter etc. Currently, the options for open-sourced language\nmodel in Indonesia Bahasa are very limited, only pre-trained static word\nembeddings such as word2vec, fasttext etc are available. It would be beneficial\nto the community if we have a good state-of-the-art attention-based transformer\nmodel for the language. Stay tuned for more updates from the Cartography Data\nScience team. ?\n\nLeave a ? if you liked what you read.

CartoBERT tokenizer is then created with the subword vocabularies and further used to encode and tokenize the same preprocessed bookings text to form pre-trained input files.</p><p>Same as ALBERT, the model is pre-trained to ‘understand’ Gojek’s bookings text using Masked Language Model — which predicts randomly masked tokens in input sentences — and Sentence Order Prediction tasks, which predicts the order of input sentences pair.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1386/1*STaqWssxlYPhFaDulLwJzg.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><h2 id=\"fine-tuning-cartobert-to-extract-pickup-point-names-from-gojek-bookings-text\">Fine-tuning CartoBERT to extract pickup point names from Gojek bookings text</h2><p>With the huge amount of bookings text we have at Gojek, now CartoBERT can better ‘understand’ past bookings text. Theoretically, it ‘understands’ every word of a booking text sentence.</p><p>For every token in the input sentence, CartoBERT will output a 768-dimension vector (we use the default hidden layer size of the ALBERT base model in CartoBERT, however this is configurable) from last transformer encoder layer, and we use that to represent CartoBERT’s ‘understanding’ of the token’s meaning in the sentence context for fine-tune step.</p><p>As illustrated in the diagram below, while fine-tuning CartoBERT for pickup point name recognition, we replace the Masked Language Model and Sequence Order Prediction layers from CartoBERT in pre-train step with token classification layer. The token classification layer learns to predict the probability of a token belonging to a pickup point name, with the final token representation output from CartoBERT transformer layers, from labelled training data created with bookings text sentences, and corresponding pickup point names. Here, we use weighted cross entropy loss to deal with class imbalance, as tokens tagged to pickup point names are a minority.</p><p></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1526/1*WO1LRHQPqAqzpLBMMl-NuA.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>With this, CartoBERT is fine-tuned to extract pickup point names from bookings text sentences, if any.</p><h2 id=\"how-does-the-model-perform\">How does the model perform?</h2><p>CartoBERT gives a lift of more than 25% in pickup point name accuracy to ~93% accuracy, which is measured as the percentage of valid pick up point names out of generated names. With this high accuracy, we have achieved full scalability of automatic generation for named pickup points to quickly cover multiple geographies without heavy reliance on human inputs.</p><h1 id=\"what-s-next\">What’s next?</h1><p>We are not stopping here and are exploring using active learning to further improve CartoBERT. With active learning, we only flag out uncertain predictions, which are measured as sentence level least token probability[3] for human labelling. We then use human-curated data as feedback for model learning. In this way, we can improve model learning efficiency with minimum labelling effort.</p><p>What’s more, with the success of CartoBERT, we are considering pre-training and open sourcing a general Indonesia Bahasa ALBERT model with Indonesia open corpus from wiki, news, Twitter etc. Currently, the options for open-sourced language model in Indonesia Bahasa are very limited, only pre-trained static word embeddings such as word2vec, fasttext etc are available. It would be beneficial to the community if we have a good state-of-the-art attention-based transformer model for the language. Stay tuned for more updates from the Cartography Data Science team. ?</p><p>Leave a ? if you liked what you read.

Thinking about burgers and crispy chicken fritters\nwith creamy sauces sitting on a warm, soft bun? At least, that’s what I am\nthinking about. May be you’re different. Vegan perhaps? Or craving noodles? Each\nof us turn into a different person when we are hungry, and this is the story\nabout how GoFood — Gojek’s food delivery service — helps you find the bite you\ncrave.\n\n> At the core of the food ordering experience, sits search.\nSearches are part of so many of our interactions on web and mobile, that we\ndon’t even notice it anymore. This is mostly because modern search engines have\nmatured to a point where they can deliver high quality results even if the\nentered query is a weak signal of the user’s intent. Even when weak, every query\nstill contains a piece of the user’s intent.\n\nIn the case of GoFood, that piece is a fragment of our user’s hunger-driven\nbrain.\n\nIn this post, we’ll discuss how we personalise the search results we surface on\nGoFood, based on the information we have about our users’ food preferences.\n\nHow Each of Us Differ\nLet’s look at two of our GoFood users who have started feeling the pangs of\nhunger, and come online to check restaurants near them.\n\nThey both open our app and click on the NEAR ME tile that lets users find the\nrestaurants near them. We show them the nearest restaurants first, and this is\nwhat they both see.\n\n\nThis list goes on and on and will let them see each restaurant which is farther\nand farther away. They can now peruse the menus of each restaurant and pick one\nthat serves what they feel like ordering. The problem is that they may spend\nsome time scrolling and then leave the app without being able to make up their\nminds around which restaurant to place an order from. We have thrown too many\nchoices at them and the cognitive effort of picking a restaurant and then a dish\nfrom the menu is too much work to make them suffer through.\n\nBut wait. Both Mila and Husain have transacted with us in the past, and we know\na fair bit about their preferences. 🤔\n\nTo make this experience better, we decided to build a system that would let both\nof them see restaurants that suit their own tastes and preferences\n\nApplying Machine Learning to the Problem\nRanking documents for relevance works by assigning a prediction score to each\ndocument retrieved, which is directly proportional to its relevance. In the case\nof NEAR ME restaurant ranking this can be something like:\n\n> Relevance score = 2 * (1/distance) + 1.2 * rating of restaurant\nHere in the relevance score calculation, we are taking weighted sum of different\nfactors like (1/distance) and rating of restaurant. The coefficients/weights of\nthese factors can be arrived at by experimenting with them and choosing weights\nthat seem to maximise the ordering conversions. But, in the case of restaurant\nranking in GoFood, we want to take into consideration many factors when deciding\nrelevance. Unfortunately, experimenting with combinations of all those factors\nis impossible.\n\nEnter Learning to rank. Here, the problem of deciding the rank of the\nrestaurants shown to the user is formulated as a supervised machine learning\nproblem.\n\nIf we look at past search, click, and ordering data, we will be able to assign\nrelevance judgements to each restaurant listing according to whether our users\nclicked or ordered from one of those restaurants. Restaurants that attracted\nhigher degrees of interest will be given higher degrees of relevance.\n\nIn the below example, a relevance judgement level of 0,1 and 2 is assigned to a\nrestaurant according to whether the user viewed, clicked, or ordered from the\nrestaurant in the search result. The relevance judgements are relative and only\nintent to be monotonically increasing with increasing relevance . They say that\nthe restaurant which the user created an order from is more relevant than a\nrestaurant the user merely checked out by clicking on it. They don’t mean that\nthe restaurant which received the order is twice as relevant .\n\nThe values of each of the factors that could have played a role in the user’s\ndecision of clicking or ordering is also shown against the restaurants.\n\nThree of the factors/features in the above example are marked as\n‘personalisation features’ because they would change according to the user’s\nprevious order history and location. These will be the features that will be\ndifferent between Mila and Husain because of the differences in the restaurants\nand cuisines they have ordered from before in the past.\n\n> These personalisation features are at the crux of creating personalised\nexperiences for each user\nOther customer agnostic features/factors like the rating, price range, and\npopularity of the restaurant are also listed here. GoFood has millions of such\nexamples where users with different tastes made different decisions when shown a\nset of search results. These examples can now be used to create a dataset from\nwhich the learning to rank ML algorithm can create a model to decide how\nrelevant a GoFood user would find a restaurant given that user’s location, order\nhistory and other restaurant statistics.\n\nHow We Ranked\nOne way to approach this was as a point-wise ranking problem, wherein we try to\npredict the relevance judgement of each restaurant. Based on this, later we will\npredict the relevance judgement level and sort restaurants in decreasing order\nof predicted relevance score. This approach reduces learning to rank problem to\na regression problem.\n\nAnother approach was to solve it is a pairwise ranking problem, wherein the ML\nmodel is trying to learn how to get the order of a pair of restaurants correct\ni.e if Restaurant A is more preferable to Restaurant B , the order (Restaurant\nA, Restaurant B) is correct and the order (Restaurant B, Restaurant A) is wrong.\n\nFor an ML model to be learned, we need an objective function that captures this\npairwise ordering formulation . This is called a loss function or error function\nin ML and is the measure through which an ML model can assess how right or wrong\nits decision was. In pairwise ranking , this should be a function that becomes\nhigher whenever the model misjudges a preference order and becomes lower when it\nis right about the preference order.\n\nThe loss/error function C is explained below:\n\nWhen this function is minimised, the model is trying to predict a score for each\nrestaurant such that the ranking of the order of the restaurants are close the\nrelevance judgements the users made.\n\nThe pairwise formulation is a better approach here in comparison to the\npoint-wise approach as it is looking to get the order of restaurants right and\nis not trying to estimate the relevance score themselves whose values were\nassigned only as markers to show how some restaurants were more preferred\nrelative to others.\n\nWe used an implementation of the LambdaMART algorithm that learns to predict\nrelevance scores so as to minimise this pairwise loss. You can think of this as\na pursuit to find the decision tree that takes in all the parameters of the\nrestaurant and gives out a score to the restaurant . This score should be\nassigned in such a way as to make the pair orders right.\n\nOnce this model is trained, it can be used during search, as explained in this\npost\n[https://blog.gojekengineering.com/how-the-gojek-butler-serves-a-gourmet-meal-to-our-users-4a161d83052a?source=friends_link&sk=42397976fe914a418ac40f19545f90b7]\n.\n\nNow let’s go back to our beloved customers — Mila and Husain. The next time Mila\nor Husain looks for restaurants near them, the search results they see will be\naccording to their preferences. This is because the model would look at the\nnumber of times they have ordered from each of the restaurants near them before.\nIt would take their preferred cuisines and factors like restaurant ratings into\naccount, and show them the restaurants that they would prefer to order from\nfirst.\n\nThe different search results Mila and Husain get after learning to rank is used\nto re-rank the results are shown below.\n\nWe ran an AB test using this formulation of learning to rank and observed a\nrelative lift of 20% in search to ordering conversions and 23% improvement in\nNDCG. More information on how this metric is calculated here\n[https://blog.gojekengineering.com/is-this-what-you-were-looking-for-439bf012cca6?source=friends_link&sk=bdc1310acc3b6a8270f10284cb30fa53]\n.\n\nWhat We Learned\nOne interesting thing we observed as we started experimenting with this learning\nto rank model was personalising search results led to the average position at\nwhich the search to order conversions happen to be much higher on the list. This\nis because users were increasingly seeing the restaurants that they have some\naffinity towards and were able to make an ordering decision without scrolling\nmuch and without spending too much time being confused where to order from.\n\nSo that’s how we rank restaurant pairs with respect to relevance based on\navailable user data. We’ll continue to write more about how we make our products\nmore intuitive.

They help us validate our hypotheses without\nhaving to involve our entire user base. However, any good experiment first\nrequires the answer to the question — how do we know the right number of people\nto include in it?\n\nLet’s break down why this is important. If we target too few, our experiments\nwill not detect smaller effects, leading us to miss legitimate opportunities. If\nwe target too many, we would be wasting resources and potentially hurting our\nbusiness metrics (if the treatments turn out to be detrimental).\n\nPreviously, we used simple heuristics (and a mysterious formula) to estimate the\nrequired sample size. These practices were not very scientific and produced\ninconsistent experimental results. To compensate, we had to repeat the same\nexperiment multiple times just to validate the results. Sometimes different\niterations would conflict with each other, leaving everyone scratching their\nheads.\n\nLast year, we ditched those unscientific practices and built a new tool called\nSample Size Calculator (yes, imaginative name, we know). This post explains how\nthe calculator helps us find the right number of people to include in\nexperiments.\n\nOur calculator is based on Frequentist school of statistics. Under the hood, we\nused both the pwr\n[https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pwr/vignettes/pwr-vignette.html] \npackage and the base sample size calculation functions in R programming\nlanguage. This is what the tool looks like:\n\nFigure 1. Screenshot of the Sample Size Calculator used at GojekThe most\nimportant parameters are the type of dependent variable measured, the historical\ndata, and the required sensitivity from the experiment. As you can see in the\ngraph, if we increase sensitivity to allow detection of smaller effects, the\nrequired sample size soars, which makes sense.\n\nAlthough this is a major step in the right direction, there is a problem if we\nare interested in a continuous dependent variable for our experiment. This is\nbecause the underlying methodology used in the calculator assumes a normal\ndistribution, while most continuous metrics that we care about at Gojek — such\nas bookings per user — are usually skewed. By ‘skewed’, we mean that most users\nare light users and only a small percentage are heavy users. This could cause\nthe computed sample size requirement to be wrong because a key assumption was\nnot met.\n\nWe have four options to deal with this problem:\n\n 1. Use a methodology that doesn’t assume normality. Unfortunately, the\n    available non-parametric methods are complex to implement [1\n    [http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~ejohnson/regression/Sample%20Size%20Power%20Considerations.pdf]\n    ] [2 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4423589/]]\n 2. Transform data to have a normal distribution. This doesn’t always work —\n    some data just can’t be coerced to normal\n 3. Use a larger sample size. Since the worry is lower power than expected,\n    simple multiplication should boost the power, but the multiplier needs to be\n    reasonable. Figuring the right multiplier would be another beast on its own\n 4. Ignore it. This is the path we took\n\n> But but but… that’s not scientific!\nDon’t worry. We tested the robustness of this solution before going ahead with\nit.\n\nAs you can see in the graph below, we created two right-skewed distributions\nwith known 5% difference in means to serve as our populations. The plan is to\ncontinuously sample from this population (equivalent to replicating the same\nexperiment many times) and see how often we can detect this 5% difference (aka\nwhat is our “power [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_(statistics)]”).\n\nFigure 2. Two right-skewed distributions (typical shape for continuous metric at\nGojek) with known mean difference (lift) of 5%The first step is to calculate the\nrequired sample size with a power of 80% and minimum detectable effect of 5%.\nLet’s refer to this sample size requirement as the “exact” size. Then we divide\nand multiply it by three and call them “less” and “more”, respectively. For each\nsample size, we sample from the populations, compute the mean difference\n(typically called “lift”), and repeat this procedure many times.\n\nThe resulting distributions of lifts are shown below. The coloured vertical\nlines show the average lift of each experimental size, which is also equal to\nthe actual population lift. This is central limit theorem\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem] at work. What is\ninteresting are the relative shapes of the sampling distributions. The “more”\ngroup is the safest and most consistent but the “exact” group seems to have good\naccuracy with only a third of the sample size. In the “less” group, we even see\na non-negligible number of lifts that are negative, even though we know the\npopulation lift is actually +5%. This is in line with our intuition that larger\nsample size is generally more trustworthy than a smaller one, all else being\nequal.\n\nFigure 3. Sampling distribution of the mean difference from each size groupSince\nwe currently report the statistical significance of our experimental results at\nGojek, we will also run t-test for each of our sample here.\n\nAs it turns out, 80.4% of the experiments in the “exact” group have\nstatistically significant results (p < 0.05), which is almost equal to the 80%\npower we set in the sample size calculator. In layman’s terms, the tool roughly\npromised that if you run the experiment with this sample size, you have 80%\nchance of detecting a 5% lift (the minimum detectable effect) if it’s there.\n\nSince it kept its promise even on non-normally distributed data, we can conclude\nthat the methodology is robust to some degree of violation of the normality\nassumption. Therefore we can ignore it until otherwise proven.\n\nFigure 4. Percentage of samples/experiments with statistically significant\nresults (p < 0.05) from each size groupMeanwhile, the “less” group had only ~34%\nstatistically significant results, suggesting that we shouldn’t run an\nexperiment if we cannot fulfil the sample size requirement — since we risk not\nbeing able to detect an existing effect. With the “more” group having close to\n100% statistically significant results, we again reaffirm that larger sample\nsize is generally a good thing if we can afford it.\n\nSince it was deployed in mid-2018, many teams across Gojek have adopted the\nSample Size Calculator. So far, nearly 1,000 experiments have incorporated this\ntool in their designs, and it is also a part of Litmus, our experimentation\nplatform\n[https://blog.gojekengineering.com/introducing-litmus-gojeks-own-experimentation-platform-3803467b6a53]\n. The more critical takeaway for us is that the experiments run using the\nrecommended sample sizes have similar results when full-scaled. This fact has\nenabled us to iterate faster and cut waste while maintaining a high degree of\nconfidence in the experimental results. ✌️\n\nDid we mention Gojek’s Growth team is hiring analysts? We are a super\ndata-driven team and have helped shape some of the company’s best practices\nthrough projects like this. If you are analytical, interested in sharpening your\ntechnical chops, and want to have a meaningful impact to Gojek’s hypergrowth,\ncome join us!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFor more updates like this, don’t forget to sign up for our newsletter\n[https://mailchi.mp/go-jek/gojek-tech-newsletter]!","html":"<p>Experiments are wonderful things.

The plan is to continuously sample from this population (equivalent to replicating the same experiment many times) and see how often we can detect this 5% difference (aka what is our “<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_(statistics)\" rel=\"noopener\">power</a>”).</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1120/0*vJpyQEMT_z3AgDSs\" class=\"kg-image\"><figcaption><strong>Figure 2.</strong> Two right-skewed distributions (typical shape for continuous metric at Gojek) with known mean difference (lift) of 5%</figcaption></figure><p>The first step is to calculate the required sample size with a power of 80% and minimum detectable effect of 5%. Let’s refer to this sample size requirement as the “exact” size. Then we divide and multiply it by three and call them “less” and “more”, respectively. For each sample size, we sample from the populations, compute the mean difference (typically called “lift”), and repeat this procedure many times.</p><p>The resulting distributions of lifts are shown below. The coloured vertical lines show the average lift of each experimental size, which is also equal to the actual population lift. This is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem\" rel=\"noopener\">central limit theorem</a> at work. What is interesting are the relative shapes of the sampling distributions. The “more” group is the safest and most consistent but the “exact” group seems to have good accuracy with only a third of the sample size. In the “less” group, we even see a non-negligible number of lifts that are negative, even though we know the population lift is actually +5%. This is in line with our intuition that larger sample size is generally more trustworthy than a smaller one, all else being equal.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1120/0*Jtrd9syTiZADm04j\" class=\"kg-image\"><figcaption><strong>Figure 3.</strong> Sampling distribution of the mean difference from each size group</figcaption></figure><p>Since we currently report the statistical significance of our experimental results at Gojek, we will also run t-test for each of our sample here.</p><p>As it turns out, 80.4% of the experiments in the “exact” group have statistically significant results (p &lt; 0.05), which is almost equal to the 80% power we set in the sample size calculator. In layman’s terms, the tool roughly promised that <em><em>if you run the experiment with this sample size, you have 80% chance of detecting a 5% lift (the minimum detectable effect) if it’s there.</em></em></p><p>Since it kept its promise even on non-normally distributed data, we can conclude that the methodology is robust to some degree of violation of the normality assumption. Therefore we can ignore it until otherwise proven.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1120/0*zF3ocylJM9iMEDue\" class=\"kg-image\"><figcaption><strong>Figure 4.</strong> Percentage of samples/experiments with statistically significant results (p &lt; 0.05) from each size group</figcaption></figure><p>Meanwhile, the “less” group had only ~34% statistically significant results, suggesting that we shouldn’t run an experiment if we cannot fulfil the sample size requirement — since we risk not being able to detect an existing effect. With the “more” group having close to 100% statistically significant results, we again reaffirm that larger sample size is generally a good thing if we can afford it.</p><p>Since it was deployed in mid-2018, many teams across Gojek have adopted the Sample Size Calculator. So far, nearly 1,000 experiments have incorporated this tool in their designs, and it is also a part of <a href=\"https://blog.gojekengineering.com/introducing-litmus-gojeks-own-experimentation-platform-3803467b6a53\" rel=\"noopener\">Litmus, our experimentation platform</a>. The more critical takeaway for us is that the experiments run using the recommended sample sizes have similar results when full-scaled. This fact has enabled us to iterate faster and cut waste while maintaining a high degree of confidence in the experimental results. ✌️</p><p>Did we mention Gojek’s Growth team is hiring analysts?

Here’s\nwhat’s different:\n\nThere are two subtle changes — the colour of the button is a different shade of\ngreen and the elevation is also different.\n\nIn Asphalt\n[https://blog.gojekengineering.com/ux-engineering-at-gojek-9de2abe24928], our\ndesign language system, we want to make sure our UI components are robust and\ndetect breakages early. Here’s how we leveraged screenshot tests to achieve\nthis.\n\nComponents Everywhere\nAsphalt Components in Gojek appWith Asphalt, we create components that can be\nreused across the Gojek app. Every button, text, input, or card which you see in\nmost of the screens of the app is an Asphalt Component. On top of this, we have\na demo app which showcases the usage of these components.\n\nAsphalt Components in Demo appOur components are the backbone of the Gojek app\nUI. For example, our button class has 300+ occurrences across Gojek’s consumer\napp codebase. This heavy reuse helps us enforce design guidelines across the\napp. The importance of these components requires that we test them thoroughly,\nas even a small regression in one component could mean a degraded experience for\nour users.\n\n[U]n[I]t Testing\nUnit tests are supposed to test logic and fail when expectations aren’t met. How\ndo we expect that a certain UI is being rendered properly?\n\nThe idea of screenshot testing is to have a master copy of screenshots that we\nknow are correct and on every test run compare the current screenshots to the\nmaster copy. If the current set does not match the master set, the test fails.\nThis will allow us to check unintentional UI changes. If the changes are\nintentional, then we run the tests in update mode which updates the master\nscreenshots.\n\nHere is the high level outline:\n\n> - Write Espresso test for all activities in the demo\n> - Take screenshots and create a master set\n> - At every CI run take screenshots again and compare with master set\nWe started out with Shot [https://github.com/Karumi/Shot], an open source\nlibrary which allows us to take screenshots and compare them using gradle\ncommands and generate reports.\n\nHere’s what a test for our Alert component looks like 👇\n\nAchilles Heel — The Android Emulator\nWhile the Android emulator has improved a lot in recent times, we found running\nemulators in CI is still unreliable.\n\nHere are a few issues we faced:\n\n> - We had to wait to for the emulator to start up, which was only possible\nthrough a hack(y) script by continuously pinging adb commands\n> Emulator would put more memory pressure on CI runners\n> Emulators also need hardware acceleration which required us to enable kvm on our\nLinux-based machines.\nRunning Instrumentation test cases with these issues would mean our tests would\nbe flaky — and we couldn’t have that.\n\nFirebase Test Lab saves the day!\nWe decide to move away from emulators to real devices.\n\nOne idea was to have devices connected to a machine and use the machine as a\nrunner for running test cases in CI — a device test lab.\n\nBut devices come with their own baggage — maintaining them. They may be\ninterrupted by software updates, system dialogs… or get overcharged and explode!\n🔥\n\nWe found the next best thing: Firebase Test Lab\n[https://firebase.google.com/docs/test-lab] — a set of devices in cloud, managed\nautomatically and available via CLI.\n\nThis solved our device problem, but we ran into another one — Firebase Test Lab\ndoesn’t allow you to run custom gradle commands. Instead, it expects you to\nupload a debug and a test apk, and it will run the tests for you. This meant we\ncould no longer use Shot for taking screenshots and comparing them 😦\n\nWhile scratching our heads over how to overcome this problem, we found that\nFirebase Test Lab allows you\n[https://firebase.google.com/docs/test-lab/android/test-screenshots] to take\nscreenshots through a library and then retrieve them from Google Cloud Bucket.\n\nThere is also a gradle plugin [https://github.com/runningcode/fladle/] which\nautomates this process including downloading artifacts from GCP — open source to\nthe rescue again!\n\nHere’s how our test case looks like with Firebase screenshot library:\n\nFor image comparison we used ImageMagick [https://imagemagick.org/], a very\npopular and feature-packed CLI tool for image manipulation. It also allows us to\noutput a different image in case two images don’t match, which is super useful\nfor generating test failure reports.\n\nThe final piece — integrating screenshot tests into our developer workflow\nAs part of CI, we do the following things when a merge request is raised:\n\n> - Build the project\n> - Run Espresso Tests on Firebase Test Lab\n> - Retrieve screenshots and compare them with master set\n> - If any screenshot doesn’t match, we fail the build and add a comment to PR\nusing Danger [https://danger.systems/]\nDanger reporting mismatch in screenshot along with diff image.We have been using\nthis setup for some time now, and it’s worked out great for us!

Here’s what’s different:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1052/1*0Cunmda2Ctain_g4xPU3iQ.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>There are two subtle changes — the colour of the button is a different shade of green and the elevation is also different.</p><p>In <a href=\"https://blog.gojekengineering.com/ux-engineering-at-gojek-9de2abe24928\" rel=\"noopener\">Asphalt</a>, our design language system, we want to make sure our UI components are robust and detect breakages early. Here’s how we leveraged screenshot tests to achieve this.</p><h1 id=\"components-everywhere\">Components Everywhere</h1><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1584/1*UH05mhuGHielEDM4RtbOcQ.png\" class=\"kg-image\"><figcaption>Asphalt Components in Gojek app</figcaption></figure><p>With Asphalt, we create components that can be reused across the Gojek app. Every button, text, input, or card which you see in most of the screens of the app is an Asphalt Component. On top of this, we have a demo app which showcases the usage of these components.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1220/1*ixxp__0PC20bAMigugixhg.png\" class=\"kg-image\"><figcaption>Asphalt Components in Demo app</figcaption></figure><p>Our components are the backbone of the Gojek app UI. For example, our button class has 300+ occurrences across Gojek’s consumer app codebase. This heavy reuse helps us enforce design guidelines across the app. The importance of these components requires that we test them thoroughly, as even a small regression in one component could mean a degraded experience for our users.</p><h1 id=\"-u-n-i-t-testing\">[U]n[I]t Testing</h1><p>Unit tests are supposed to test logic and fail when expectations aren’t met. How do we expect that a certain UI is being rendered properly?</p><p>The idea of screenshot testing is to have a master copy of screenshots that we know are correct and on every test run compare the current screenshots to the master copy. If the current set does not match the master set, the test fails. This will allow us to check unintentional UI changes. If the changes are intentional, then we run the tests in <code>update</code> mode which updates the master screenshots.</p><p><strong><strong>Here is the high level outline:</strong></strong></p><blockquote><em><em>- Write Espresso test for all activities in the demo</em></em></blockquote><blockquote><em><em>- Take screenshots and create a master set</em></em></blockquote><blockquote><em><em>- At every CI run take screenshots again and compare with master set</em></em></blockquote><p>We started out with <a href=\"https://github.com/Karumi/Shot\" rel=\"noopener\">Shot</a>, an open source library which allows us to take screenshots and compare them using gradle commands and generate reports.</p><p>Here’s what a test for our Alert component looks like 👇</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><script src=\"https://gist.github.com/jitinsharma/c57e8afbb0b4849ff75a29eeba4dc4d1.js\"></script><!--kg-card-end: html--><h1 id=\"achilles-heel-the-android-emulator\">Achilles Heel — The Android Emulator</h1><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*WWyaL1uLibHeXC15.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>While the Android emulator has improved a lot in recent times, we found running emulators in CI is still unreliable.</p><p>Here are a few issues we faced:</p><blockquote><em><em>- We had to wait to for the emulator to start up, which was only possible through a hack(y) script by continuously pinging <code>adb</code> commands</em></em></blockquote><blockquote><em><em>Emulator would put more memory pressure on CI runners</em></em></blockquote><blockquote><em><em>Emulators also need hardware acceleration which required us to enable <code>kvm</code> on our Linux-based machines.</em></em></blockquote><p>Running Instrumentation test cases with these issues would mean our tests would be flaky — and we couldn’t have that.</p><h1 id=\"firebase-test-lab-saves-the-day-\">Firebase Test Lab saves the day!</h1><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0*IIH6x5bWvHn1Gcv_.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>We decide to move away from emulators to real devices.</p><p>One idea was to have devices connected to a machine and use the machine as a runner for running test cases in CI — a device test lab.</p><p>But devices come with their own baggage — maintaining them. They may be interrupted by software updates, system dialogs… or get overcharged and explode! 🔥</p><p>We found the next best thing: <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/test-lab\" rel=\"noopener\">Firebase Test Lab</a> — a set of devices in cloud, managed automatically and available via CLI.</p><p>This solved our device problem, but we ran into another one — Firebase Test Lab doesn’t allow you to run custom gradle commands. Instead, it expects you to upload a debug and a test apk, and it will run the tests for you. This meant we could no longer use Shot for taking screenshots and comparing them 😦</p><p>While scratching our heads over how to overcome this problem, we found that Firebase Test Lab <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/test-lab/android/test-screenshots\" rel=\"noopener\">allows you</a> to take screenshots through a library and then retrieve them from Google Cloud Bucket.</p><p>There is also a <a href=\"https://github.com/runningcode/fladle/\" rel=\"noopener\">gradle plugin</a> which automates this process including downloading artifacts from GCP — open source to the rescue again!</p><p>Here’s how our test case looks like with Firebase screenshot library:</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><script src=\"https://gist.github.com/jitinsharma/971c95389af0ae11b38f392076dc6df8.js\"></script><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>For image comparison we used <a href=\"https://imagemagick.org/\" rel=\"noopener\">ImageMagick</a>, a very popular and feature-packed CLI tool for image manipulation. It also allows us to output a different image in case two images don’t match, which is super useful for generating test failure reports.</p><h1 id=\"the-final-piece-integrating-screenshot-tests-into-our-developer-workflow\">The final piece — integrating screenshot tests into our developer workflow</h1><p>As part of CI, we do the following things when a merge request is raised:</p><blockquote><em><em>- Build the project</em></em></blockquote><blockquote><em><em>- Run Espresso Tests on Firebase Test Lab</em></em></blockquote><blockquote><em><em>- Retrieve screenshots and compare them with master set</em></em></blockquote><blockquote><em><em>- If any screenshot doesn’t match, we fail the build and add a comment to PR using <a href=\"https://danger.systems/\" rel=\"noopener\">Danger</a></em></em></blockquote><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1970/1*D6gb_yARAM4n83umso03Xw.png\" class=\"kg-image\"><figcaption>Danger reporting mismatch in screenshot along with diff image.</figcaption></figure><p>We have been using this setup for some time now, and it’s worked out great for us!

We moved from an overwhelming single\npage with too much information, to a more intuitive two-step design with a hope\nthat the new design will help our users navigate the flow better (detailed in \npart two [http://bit.ly/2FUiYDo]).\n\nWe rolled out the design to beta on August 12, 2018.\n\nThis is what our redesigned flow looked like?\n\nOne week later:\nA 10% drop in our orders!!?\n\nThat… did not go according to plan. ?\n\nBut here’s the fun part: The app worked, and the bookings went through. No major\nout-of-whack tech issues. Yet, there we were, steadily losing orders.\n\nBugs? No.\n\nServer issues? Nope.\n\nDowntime, then? Nuh-uh.\n\nAfter many such questions and no answer, we were left with just one conclusion.\n?\n\nThe design change had made things worse.\n\nJust when I thought my job was done, I realised it was only the beginning. For I\nknew, no solution was good enough until users were successfully using it.\n\nStrap in, we’re in the Endgame now ?\nPrior to launch, we had rallied the team around a common definition of success —\none that was quantifiable and easily measured. 10% drop in our orders did seem\ntragic, but we knew looking at a single metric wasn’t going to give us the full\nstory.\n\nHence along with defining success metrics for our overall conversions, we also\ndefined and tracked metrics for the smaller tasks, tasks that led the user to\nthe final goal. This helped us monitor whether users were navigating through the\nflow as intended. As a designer it was important to not restrict myself to just\nwireframes and workflows, but participate and know these numbers inside out.\n\n“Designers who are involved in setting success metrics are far better at driving\nimpact than designers who are not”\n\n— Julie Zhuo\n\nFocusing on post launch productivity ?\nWhen the overall booking rate dropped, we started digging deeper to find where\nthe frictions were in the flow. We started sifting through the finer details and\nclosely analysed the smaller tasks, the results were a bit surprising.\n\n * By moving the location card to the top, our cancellation rate for wrong\n   address selected dropped by 2% —First win☝️\n * There was no significant drop in the notes or dishes added to the cart. Much\n   to our relief, the new interface was intuitive, users were able to locate the\n   notes button and other dish details— Second win ✌️\n * Similar affirmative results with our payments and location card designs too — \n   More wins! ?\n * But, there was one issue. Most users who abandoned the flow, left it on the\n   first step itself. Which meant nearly 8% of users did not even land on the\n   second step of the redesigned flow — Big Loss ?\n\nOur sanest conclusion was to wait, and give our users some time to get a hang of\nthe new designs. After all, old habits die hard. Thousands of our users who were\npreviously used to a single step now had to break a solid habit.\n\nYes, the old design was unacceptable (well, in the designer world at least ?).\nThe new design — despite featuring enhanced UX — broke some habits for our\nusers.\n\nA week passed… then two…\n\nNothing changed. ️\n\nAfter shuffling through tons of data, we found ourselves with a bunch of\nquestions. Who were the users who abandoned their food at checkout? What were\nthey thinking? Why would they do this?\n\nTo get these answered we coupled our quantitative data with some qualitative\nresearch — below are some crude user thoughts ?\n\nThere were two major problems:\n\n 1.

We moved from an overwhelming single page with too much information, to a more intuitive two-step design with a hope that the new design will help our users navigate the flow better (detailed in <a href=\"http://bit.ly/2FUiYDo\" rel=\"noopener\">part two</a>).</p><p>We rolled out the design to beta on August 12, 2018.</p><p><strong><strong>This is what our redesigned flow looked like?</strong></strong></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1434/1*wC6FYnnJilFxFkYwab1kLw.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><h2 id=\"one-week-later-\">One week later:</h2><p>A 10% drop in our orders!!?</p><p>That… did not go according to plan. ?</p><p>But here’s the fun part: <strong><strong>The app worked, and the bookings went through.</strong></strong> No major out-of-whack tech issues. Yet, there we were, steadily losing orders.</p><p><em><em>Bugs? No.</em></em></p><p><em><em>Server issues? Nope.</em></em></p><p><em><em>Downtime, then? Nuh-uh.</em></em></p><p>After many such questions and no answer, we were left with just one conclusion. ?</p><p><strong><strong>The design change had made things worse.</strong></strong></p><p>Just when I thought my job was done, I realised it was only the beginning. For I knew, no solution was good enough until users were <strong><strong><em><em>successfully</em></em> </strong></strong>using it.</p><h1 id=\"strap-in-we-re-in-the-endgame-now-\">Strap in, we’re in the Endgame now ?</h1><p>Prior to launch, we had rallied the team around a common definition of success — one that was quantifiable and easily measured. 10% drop in our orders did seem tragic, but we knew looking at a single metric wasn’t going to give us the full story.</p><p>Hence along with defining success metrics for our overall conversions, we also defined and tracked metrics for the smaller tasks, tasks that led the user to the final goal. This helped us monitor whether users were navigating through the flow as intended. As a designer it was important to not restrict myself to just wireframes and workflows, but participate and know these numbers inside out.</p><p>“Designers who are involved in setting success metrics are far better at driving impact than designers who are not”</p><p>— Julie Zhuo</p><h1 id=\"focusing-on-post-launch-productivity-\">Focusing on post launch productivity ?</h1><p>When the overall booking rate dropped, we started digging deeper to find where the frictions were in the flow.

Many of them rely on Gojek as their preferred first mile connectivity\noption — resulting in a traffic spike on our systems on Friday evening. In those\nearly days, this often triggered a system outage.\n\nEvery outage erodes the hard earned trust we build with our customers and driver\npartners.\n\nEnter the RCA\nWe knew we couldn’t fix the failures overnight, but we could learn from them.\nAfter all, so many of these mistakes were common and easily overlooked. So we\ndecided to embrace the ‘Root Cause Analysis’ (RCA). If something related to\nGojek’s Engineering division failed, the person(s) who attended the support call\nand had most context of what happened would prepare a document. This document\nwould contain a timeline, detail what went wrong, suggest corrective measures,\nand compile lessons learned.\n\nThis process ensured everyone across the organisation had visibility into what\nhappened. As a result, even unaffected teams cited in the RCA could analyse\ntheir systems to ensure the same problem would not happen to them. More\nimportantly, it provided a degree of accountability — and that’s important when\nyou have 20+ products.\n\nA post-mortem, and a prevention.\n\nThis post details what happens when a system failure happens at Gojek, and how\nit makes it way into an RCA.\n\n1. The What\nWhen something fails, it is important to understand the origin of the problem.\nEvery team in Gojek sets up alerts which monitor the state of their systems. If\na state change in the system causes a deviation from expected behaviour, an\nalerting service called pager duty automatically dials the phones of the people\nresponsible for that part of the system.\n\nHere’s an example:\n\nWhen a booking is created, we find a list of driver partners and send the order\ndetails to them, at which point they get a pop-up with trip details like\nestimated duration and approximate earnings. The idea is to give driver partners\nenough information to make the decision to accept the trip. But there was a\nproblem.\n\n2. The Why\nOne of the fields this prompt contains is a Booking ID, which is stored as an\ninteger (which, in technical speak, has a limit of 32 bits). Unfortunately for\nus, the ID generated exceeded this limit.\n\nWelcome to what we call Integer Overflow.\n\nAs a result of this, the driver app started crashing.\n\nHow bad can that be, you ask?\n\n3. The Fallout\nDrivers being unable to use the app means they can’t accept bookings. This means\ncustomers can’t book rides, send packages, get food, or use any service that\ndepends on our driver partners.\n\nAs a result, Gojek’s order numbers (or what we call ‘concurrence’, if you want\nto get all technical about it) plummeted. Pager duty is hit, and cell phones\nstart ringing off their proverbial hooks.\n\nWith driver partners stuck with malfunctioning apps, multiple Gojek services\nstart reporting errors. As customers try and figure out why the app is behaving\nthis way, engineers scramble to do the same.\n\n4. The Response\nWhen the phones ring, the team whose alerts have been triggered immediately get\nto work figuring out what happened. If they identify the problem quickly and\ndebug it, they notify other teams. The team then gets to work using information\nfrom the alerts and system dashboards to prepare an RCA.\n\nThis is, of course, the best case scenario.\n\nIf the concerned team cannot find a fix however, a war room is called.\n\nThe war room signifies a larger issue, and members of every available team drop\nwhat they’re doing and join the call. Sometimes, these are frantic Slack\ndiscussions and calls in the middle of the night. Other times, office boardrooms\nare blocked and everyone gathers to brainstorm collectively.\n\nDevs, Team Leads, Product Managers, all hands on deck.\n\nIn a war room scenario, whoever has most context on the situation takes charge\nand delegates tasks as required. This central person also plays a key role in\ndocumenting the happenings in the war room — how many people were present, which\nteams were represented, who was handling what, etc. All this information plays a\nkey role in the RCA. While this is going down, Driver and Customer Care centres\nare also notified, bracing for the inevitable flurry of complaints.\n\nThe fix may take the form of a few simple temporary hacks, or an hours long war\nroom — but in the end, there is always a fix.\n\nWords of appreciation from GoPay CEO Aldi Haryopratomo and Gojek CTO Ajey Gore\nAnd a sense of camaraderie 💚\n\nOnce the dust settles, the investigation begins. The person who managed the war\nroom generally authors a document analysing what went wrong, using all the info\nfrom the alerts, dashboards, and firsthand accounts of the responders present.\nTypically every stakeholder in the organisation gets an email the next day with\ndetails of what went wrong — the RCA.\n\n5. The Learnings\n“Collaborate With Compassion”\n\nThese three words mean a lot at Gojek, and our RCAs reflect that. When you open\nan RCA mail, there is rarely even a mention of specific people, except to\nacknowledge those who responded to the distress call and played a role in\nfinding a fix. Call out the ones who made the effort, never the ones\nresponsible.\n\nMost RCAs instead dwell on relevant, actionable information. Information that\nwas being collected and monitored right from when the alert tripped:\n\nThe What: What was the problem?\n\nThe Why: Why did it happen?\n\nThe Fallout: Which services were affected, and for how long?\n\nThe Response: How was it fixed?\n\nThe Learnings: What can be done to avoid a repeat of this in future?\n\nThis simple process has helped us scale more safely and efficiently. It also\nallows for early identification of potential vulnerabilities in other systems.\nAs you may have noticed, there is no mention of who was responsible, no finger\npointing, no blame games.

Many of them rely on Gojek as their preferred first mile connectivity option — resulting in a traffic spike on our systems on Friday evening. In those early days, this often triggered a system outage.</p><p><em><em>Every outage erodes the hard earned trust we build with our customers and driver partners.</em></em></p><h3 id=\"enter-the-rca\">Enter the RCA</h3><p>We knew we couldn’t fix the failures overnight, but we could learn from them. After all, so many of these mistakes were common and easily overlooked. So we decided to embrace the ‘Root Cause Analysis’ (RCA). If something related to Gojek’s Engineering division failed, the person(s) who attended the support call and had most context of what happened would prepare a document. This document would contain a timeline, detail what went wrong, suggest corrective measures, and compile lessons learned.</p><p>This process ensured everyone across the organisation had visibility into what happened. As a result, even unaffected teams cited in the RCA could analyse their systems to ensure the same problem would not happen to them. More importantly, it provided a degree of accountability — and that’s important when you have 20+ products.</p><p>A post-mortem, and a prevention.</p><p>This post details what happens when a system failure happens at Gojek, and how it makes it way into an RCA.</p><h3 id=\"1-the-what\">1. The What</h3><p>When something fails, it is important to understand the origin of the problem. Every team in Gojek sets up alerts which monitor the state of their systems. If a state change in the system causes a deviation from expected behaviour, an alerting service called <code>pager duty</code> automatically dials the phones of the people responsible for that part of the system.</p><p><strong><strong>Here’s an example:</strong></strong></p><p>When a booking is created, we find a list of driver partners and send the order details to them, at which point they get a pop-up with trip details like estimated duration and approximate earnings. The idea is to give driver partners enough information to make the decision to accept the trip. But there was a problem.</p><h3 id=\"2-the-why\">2. The Why</h3><p>One of the fields this prompt contains is a Booking ID, which is stored as an integer (which, in technical speak, has a limit of 32 bits). Unfortunately for us, the ID generated exceeded this limit.</p><p>Welcome to what we call Integer Overflow.</p><p>As a result of this, the driver app started crashing.</p><p><strong><strong><em><em>How bad can that be, you ask?</em></em></strong></strong></p><h3 id=\"3-the-fallout\">3. The Fallout</h3><p>Drivers being unable to use the app means they can’t accept bookings. This means customers can’t book rides, send packages, get food, or use any service that depends on our driver partners.</p><p>As a result, Gojek’s order numbers (or what we call ‘concurrence’, if you want to get all technical about it) plummeted. Pager duty is hit, and cell phones start ringing off their proverbial hooks.</p><p>With driver partners stuck with malfunctioning apps, multiple Gojek services start reporting errors. As customers try and figure out why the app is behaving this way, engineers scramble to do the same.</p><h3 id=\"4-the-response\">4. The Response</h3><p>When the phones ring, the team whose alerts have been triggered immediately get to work figuring out what happened. If they identify the problem quickly and debug it, they notify other teams. The team then gets to work using information from the alerts and system dashboards to prepare an RCA.</p><p><strong><strong>This is, of course, the best case scenario.</strong></strong></p><p>If the concerned team cannot find a fix however, a war room is called.</p><p>The war room signifies a larger issue, and members of every available team drop what they’re doing and join the call. Sometimes, these are frantic Slack discussions and calls in the middle of the night. Other times, office boardrooms are blocked and everyone gathers to brainstorm collectively.</p><p><em><em>Devs, Team Leads, Product Managers, all hands on deck.</em></em></p><p>In a war room scenario, whoever has most context on the situation takes charge and delegates tasks as required. This central person also plays a key role in documenting the happenings in the war room — <strong><strong>how many people were present, which teams were represented, who was handling what, etc.</strong></strong> <strong><strong>All this information plays a key role in the RCA.</strong></strong> While this is going down, Driver and Customer Care centres are also notified, bracing for the inevitable flurry of complaints.</p><p>The fix may take the form of a few simple temporary hacks, or an hours long war room — but in the end, there is always a fix.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1129/1*UFUYfO3Gw9tnKCiE1y40-Q.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\"><figcaption>Words of appreciation from GoPay CEO Aldi Haryopratomo and Gojek CTO Ajey Gore</figcaption></figure><p><em><em>And a sense of camaraderie </em>💚</em></p><p>Once the dust settles, the investigation begins. The person who managed the war room generally authors a document analysing what went wrong, using all the info from the alerts, dashboards, and firsthand accounts of the responders present. Typically every stakeholder in the organisation gets an email the next day with details of what went wrong — the RCA.</p><h3 id=\"5-the-learnings\">5. The Learnings</h3><p>“Collaborate With Compassion”</p><p>These three words mean a lot at Gojek, and our RCAs reflect that. When you open an RCA mail, there is rarely even a mention of specific people, except to acknowledge those who responded to the distress call and played a role in finding a fix. <strong><strong>Call out the ones who made the effort, never the ones responsible.</strong></strong></p><p>Most RCAs instead dwell on relevant, actionable information. Information that was being collected and monitored right from when the alert tripped:</p><p><em><em>The What: What was the problem?</em></em></p><p><em><em>The Why: Why did it happen?</em></em></p><p><em><em>The Fallout: Which services were affected, and for how long?</em></em></p><p><em><em>The Response: How was it fixed?</em></em></p><p><em><em>The Learnings: What can be done to avoid a repeat of this in future?</em></em></p><p>This simple process has helped us scale more safely and efficiently. It also allows for early identification of potential vulnerabilities in other systems. As you may have noticed, there is no mention of who was responsible, no finger pointing, no blame games. <em><em>Collaborate with compassion.</em></em></p><p>To get a better sense of how we write RCAs at Gojek, <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1r_PSsl7mBxbfAcibGTdFpnM5hm6ot82bF-_9VeV2J9w/edit?ts=5db7c330#heading=h.kreykp6cjau6\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong><strong>read a sample RCA</strong></strong></a>.</p><p>If you’d like to start a culture of RCAs as well, <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/12Ims21IwFCNWi9MXcw2TVxPLB6YyWrIoTNaw3P-M_t4/edit\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong><strong>here’s our RCA template</strong></strong></a>, courtesy GoPay CTO <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rnjn\" rel=\"noopener\">Ranjan Sakalley</a>, who also occasionally drops invaluable insights in the ‘Learnings’ section. <strong><strong>😅</strong></strong><br></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/480/1*2sosYEnk68lMaQTVjdZjWQ.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>RCAs have played an integral part in our journey to becoming a SuperApp. Investigating, analysing, and documenting problems in production help us build better, more scalable systems, and tackle new problems in a mature manner without fear of retribution.</p><p>The days of weekly production issues are now a thing of the past.

GoFood — Gojek’s food\ndelivery product — lists 400,000+ merchants. You search for the outlet you want\nto order from, select the item and quantity, check out, and pay either via cash\nor Gojek’s digital wallet GoPay. Then, you sit back and watch the little Gojek\ndriver partner on the screen zoom their way to the restaurant, and bring you\nsome fried banana goodness. 😍\n\nSimple. Fast. Reliable.\n\n> Rewind a few years, and things didn’t look so good.\nFirst, some context\nWhen GoFood launched in 2015, expansion and adoption happened rapidly. The\norders started piling in, and we were struggling to keep up with demand.\nInitially, we’d simply list food merchants on our marketplace, send demand their\nway, and fulfil it through our fleet of driver partners.\n\nWe were building for our consumers and driver partners, but merchants were\nalways a key component of our ecosystem. If Gojek is an iceberg, the\nconsumer-facing Super App is the part above water. In this story, we’ll dive\nbeneath the surface to explore another key component — GoBiz, our merchant\nSuperApp.\n\n> But before GoBiz, there was GoResto.\nThe Merchant Problem\nIf we had ordered ourselves that pisang goreng in the early days of GoFood,\nthings would have worked very differently.\n\nYou see, merchants were onboarded by the GoFood team by uploading their menus to\nour systems. We’d look through these menus to find our fried banana of choice,\nand make an order, which would be relayed directly to a driver partner. This\npartner would then go to the restaurant and place the order (which is when the\nmerchant partner gets involved in the process).\n\nSo, while our bananas are fried, the driver partner would wait around, and when\nthe order is ready, pay in cash. The problem with this approach was that there\nwas no record of the transaction besides a booking on GoFood and a receipt\nhanded to the driver partner.\n\nThis was an inefficient system, for driver partners, and our customers.\n\n> Oh, and those merchants? Things weren’t rosy for them either.\nLet’s assume our pisang goreng place is a GoFood partner (meaning Gojek collects\ncommissions for the increased demand we send their way), and also part of a\nlarger chain. When we place the order, GoFood will assign it to one outlet of\nthe chain. However, our driver partner may decide to visit another outlet and\npick up the order from there.\n\nAt the end of the month, our restaurant partners would be invoiced for\ncommission that was due to us, based on sales as reported by the GoFood app.\nThis meant we were charging some merchants commission for sales their outlet may\nhave never made.\n\nWe spent a lot of time and resources addressing merchant complaints. 🤦‍♂️\n\n> Then there was the matter of control.\nIf a merchant partner was not open for business on a particular day, wanted to\nupdate their menu, or indicate items as out of stock, they had to call Gojek\nCustomer Care. During this time, orders might still be coming in.\n\nLet’s just say we weren’t doing ourselves any favours. 🤷🏻‍♂️\n\nThere was a lot that needed fixing here, and it could only be done by\nintegrating merchants more deeply into our ecosystem. So that’s what we did.\n\nThe birth of GoResto\nTowards the end of 2016, a concept was developed for an app that would cater to\nGoFood merchant partners, and by early 2017 GoResto — which is what we called it\nat the time — was ready. You can read more about the product research process\nthat went into making GoResto here\n[https://blog.gojekengineering.com/whats-cooking-diving-into-kitchens-for-go-biz-e01051bfdc98]\n).\n\nWith GoResto, we addressed some of the problems outlined earlier.\n\n1. Electronic payments\nAll of Gojek’s driver partners had GoPay e-wallets associated with their\naccounts. With GoResto, we did the same for GoFood merchants. Transactions\nbetween driver and merchant partners would now be wallet-to-wallet, not cash.\nGojek would deduct any applicable commission immediately from the merchant\nwallet. This made the reconciliation process with merchants simpler.\n\n2. PIN exchange for restaurant verification\nTo eliminate fraud, driver partners would also need to share a PIN with the\nmerchant while picking up the order. This electronic handshake helped us verify\nthey were indeed picking up the right order from the right outlet.\n\nIt was a decent solution. If all went according to plan, we could breathe easy.\n\n> As you might have guessed, all did not go according to plan. 🙇‍♂️\nIn the first iteration, the wallet creation process required collaboration with\nthe GoPay team, which was itself facing bandwidth constraints due to rapid\ngrowth (which we’ll talk about a little later).\n\nAlso, the merchant onboarding to GoResto at this point was still a manual\nprocess. In our first month, we onboarded only 26 merchants. 😣\n\nWe needed a more scalable solution.\n\nHere’s a quick note on Gojek company culture. When the chips are down, it’s\nimportant for organisations to have core values to guide decision-making. One of\nour values happens to be:\n\nThis line is an affirmation to all stakeholders to take the best decision for a\nparticular situation based on available information. Such decisions are then\nrespected by everyone else.\n\nWe made two drastic decisions:\n\n 1. Merchant onboarding was completely frozen until we could build a platform to\n    automate the process.\n 2. Engineers from the Merchants team were embedded within GoPay, building\n    required capacities on GoPay systems while core GoPay engineers continued\n    work on scaling the platform.\n\n> In three months, as summer rolled around, GoResto was back.\nWe weren’t out of the woods yet though. All this was happening before Gojek had\ndeprecated its legacy codebase, Stan Marsh\n[https://blog.gojekengineering.com/thank-you-stan-marsh-29db553544bf], in favour\nof microservices, so system stability was not exactly excellent. As a result, we\nstill faced sync issues between GoFood and GoResto order management systems.\nThis, in turn, began to reflect on us publicly.\n\nOur app store rating at this point slid down to 3.2.\n\nMake It Work, Then Make It Better\nWe clearly had a long way to go to make GoResto the app our merchants deserved.\nThings were bad, but as they say — sometimes the only way out is through.\n\nChallenge accepted. 💪\n\nFirst things first, we went about fixing the sync issues by building a second\nsystem to replace our unreliable version. Not only was this accomplished, but\nall onboarded merchants were migrated to the new system, with zero downtime. \nRead more about how this was done in this post\n[https://blog.gojekengineering.com/zero-downtime-traffic-migration-at-go-food-17ba413eb8c2]\n.\n\n> One small win.\nNow for the real problems, giving merchants the control they needed over how\nthey were represented on GoFood. The first self-serve feature we introduced to\nGoResto was allowing merchants to update their restaurant status in real time.\n\n> Another small win.\nWe had unlocked a critical component in product design — empathy for the people\nyou’re building for. The question now was — what can we do that will make life\neasier for our merchants?\n\nItem availability? Understood.\nMenu updation? Got it.\nPricing adjustments? Why not.\nAdd categories? Move items between categories? Update images?\n\n> Done, done… and done. ✅\nOur systems were stable, early teething troubles were addressed, we were finally\nsolving the problems that needed solving.\n\nBuild It Right, And They Will Come\nAs GoResto grew in functionality, we began\n\n slowly earning back the goodwill of our merchant community. Soon, our app store\nrating began to reflect that.\n\nApp store ratings reflecting how customer goodwill can be earned back ✌️We\ndidn’t need to push GoResto to merchants anymore, it was adopted due to the ease\nof doing business it offered.\n\n> It was long overdue, but we had accomplished what we had set out to do. There\nwas finally a moment to sit back and enjoy the sunrise.\nOr so we thought.\n\nThe rest was short-lived. Southeast Asia was abuzz with activity. According to\nthis report\n[https://www.blog.google/documents/47/SEA_Internet_Economy_Report_2019.pdf], the\nvalue of the Internet economy in the region tripled in the years since 2015. The\nGross Merchandise Value (GMV) projection for 2025 is estimated to be $300\nbillion.\n\n> To put that in perspective — in 2016, that projection was $100 billion.\nEven as GoResto was being built, there was another behemoth stirring under the\nrich waters of Indonesia’s digital payments landscape. GoPay, which had been\nrapidly growing in this favourable environment since its arrival in 2016, was\nnow being used by roughly three-quarters of digital payments users in Indonesia.\n\nBut we wanted more.\n\nIn 2018, GoPay introduced offline acceptance, bringing a whole new category of\nmerchant partners into our ecosystem.\n\n> Our existing solution wasn’t good enough anymore. It was time to evolve.\nKeep watching this space for the continued story charting GoResto’s evolution\ninto our full-fledged merchants platform — GoBiz.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWant our updates beamed straight to your inbox?

The GO-VIET launch had gone better\nthan anticipated, and our attempt to build robust, scalable systems looked to\nhave paid off. Ride and Send services were live in Vietnam, and engineers from\nGO-FOOD had already started working with Trifecta — the team spearheading\nGOJEK’s international moves — to launch our food product in Vietnam (FYI, it’s\nlive now).\n\nIn the months following Vietnam launch, Trifecta focused on setting up cadences\nwith different GOJEK product teams to streamline development and release cycles\nfor GO-VIET. Everything was up and running.\n\nNow, for the next stage — Thailand.\n\nThe launch plan for Thailand was similar to what had been executed in Vietnam,\nincluding the products made available at launch (Ride and Send). In Thailand,\nthe brand would launch under the name GET.\n\n> We had proven it could be done. Now it was time to do it again. Easy, right?\nAs would soon become apparent, not really. This ride had a few last twists left.\n\nA Different Method\nWhile our Thailand operation would be similar to Vietnam on the infrastructure\nfront, to say we could just replicate the model as is would be an\noversimplification. For starters, Thailand’s currency, the Thai Baht, was not a\ndepreciated currency like Indonesian Rupiah or Vietnamese Dong.\n\n> Here’s some context:\n> 1 Indonesian Rupiah (IDR) = 0.0049 INR\n1 Vietnamese Dong (VND) = 0.0030 INR\n1 Thai Baht (THB) = 2.2 INR\nIncorporating this change would require some additional work from the team. On\ntop of this, the ride sharing market in Thailand is regulated by the Thai\ngovernment. Existing bike taxis (locally called WIN taxis) are licensed by the\ngovernment to serve as an effective mode of transportation. GOJEK’s entry into\nthe market provided an opportunity for WIN drivers to leverage the online\nplatform, while giving customers easy access to transportation\n\nThis arrangement required some work as well, as existing WIN drivers onboarded\nto GET would need to be prioritised initially while our own onboarding and\ntraining happened in parallel. All this meant that the launch model needed some\ntweaking, but nothing the team would need to sweat over too much.\n\nTalks were completed, local business teams were built, and a deadline was agreed\nupon with the Thai government to launch GET.\n\n> We should have known; rarely do companies building, scaling, and expanding at\nGOJEK’s pace experience such smooth sailing.\nThe Singapore Swing\nWorks, meet spanner.\n\nDue to the seismic shift in the ride-sharing business landscape of Southeast\nAsia in early 2018, GOJEK was also prepping for launch in Singapore on an\naccelerated timeline. Now was a good time to enter the lucrative market — the\nmost developed in the region. GOJEK already enjoyed brand recognition thanks to\nthe amount of business travel between Jakarta and Singapore. By May 2018, a few\nmonths before GO-VIET went live, the launch teams for Singapore had already been\nformed.\n\n> Keeping with Singapore’s iconic lion motif, we named these teams Simba and\nMufasa.

Multiple teams were\ndependent on the same resources as we lined up back-to-back country launches. To\ntop it all, holiday season — one of the busiest times of the year — was also\nkicking off.\n\nvia GIPHY [https://giphy.com/gifs/2oj7STwCx7wAM]\n\nWhile Trifecta had built much of the infrastructure framework required for\nlaunch, there were still dependencies on key GOJEK teams that were currently\nbuilding for Singapore.

The stakes were not trivial.\n\n> The team could not afford to lose more time. Time for desperate measures.\nWith just about a month left for launch, the team members — distributed across\nmultiple locations — convened at the GOJEK Bangalore office. All the\ndocumentation done during the pre-Vietnam launch phase meant that everyone had a\nfair idea of what needed to be done. Launching Singapore and Thailand without\ndelay was critical to business, and we could not afford delays.\n\nWith this in mind, tough decisions were made. The Trifecta team decided to roll\nup their sleeves and take full ownership of Thailand, freeing up the GOJEK\nTransport team to dedicate more resources to Singapore. Trifecta team members\nflew in to Thailand to coordinate the work there, and the project slowly picked\nup steam once again. All the legwork done at the beginning of this exercise had\ncome to fruition.\n\nThe team now had enough context about GOJEK services, and as the days to launch\nticked away, so did the items on the pre-launch checklist.\n\nIt took some doing, with the environment and frameworks built and stabilised\nwhile activities like driver onboarding and early alpha testing happened in\nparallel.\n\n> The going was not easy, but this wasn’t our first rodeo.\nTrifecta Tech Lead Sumit Gupta, who was around in early 2016 during GOJEK’s\nfrantic growth as well, mentions how everyone was more confident this time\naround.

If you haven’t\nread part one, get up to speed here.\n\nPart 2/3 | Initiation\nWhen we left Trifecta — the team responsible for charting GOJEK’s international\nexpansion — in the last part of this series, the team was working on setting up\na new environment for launch in Vietnam. But now, there were new problems to\ntackle.\n\nProblem #1: Configuration drift\n\nUntil this point, GOJEK had always operated within Indonesia, but Trifecta was\nnow in unmapped territory, building a completely new environment for GOJEK’s\nservices in Vietnam. The services now needed to be configured separately across\ngeographies, and there was no central location to manage these configurations\neffectively. This meant there was a chance of configuration inconsistencies\ncreeping in over time (hence the term ‘drift’).\n\nProblem #2: Deployment drift\n\nEven if the team hacked a solution for the first problem, deploying the code\nwould pose another one. It was imperative that the same version of code run on\nall the environments (the existing one in Indonesia, the one being built for\nVietnam, and any future ones). Failing this, supporting services across\ncountries would be a nightmare.\n\n> That wasn’t the kind of risk a startup that expounds lean engineering could\nafford to take.\nProblem #3: A logging and monitoring solution for the Kubernetes cluster.\n\nAs this was the first time containers were being used by GOJEK, a new logging\nsolution would be required for future debugging needs.\n\nMuch time had been lost already, it was time to bring in the big guns.\n\nEven as the team dodged obstacles and took detours, making the best use of\navailable resources, Project Managers Sourabh Gupta and Sanchit Juneja had been\ncommunicating with other teams for backup.

If you haven’t read part one, get up to speed here.</p><h1 id=\"part-2-3-initiation\">Part 2/3 | Initiation</h1><p>When we left Trifecta — the team responsible for charting GOJEK’s international expansion — in the last part of this series, the team was working on setting up a new environment for launch in Vietnam. But now, there were new problems to tackle.</p><p><strong><strong>Problem #1: Configuration drift</strong></strong></p><p>Until this point, GOJEK had always operated within Indonesia, but Trifecta was now in unmapped territory, building a completely new environment for GOJEK’s services in Vietnam. The services now needed to be configured separately across geographies, and there was no central location to manage these configurations effectively. This meant there was a chance of configuration inconsistencies creeping in over time (hence the term ‘drift’).</p><p><strong><strong>Problem #2: Deployment drift</strong></strong></p><p>Even if the team hacked a solution for the first problem, deploying the code would pose another one. It was imperative that the same version of code run on all the environments (the existing one in Indonesia, the one being built for Vietnam, and any future ones). Failing this, supporting services across countries would be a nightmare.</p><blockquote><em><em>That wasn’t the kind of risk a startup that expounds lean engineering could afford to take.</em></em></blockquote><p><strong><strong>Problem #3: A logging and monitoring solution for the Kubernetes cluster.</strong></strong></p><p>As this was the first time containers were being used by GOJEK, a new logging solution would be required for future debugging needs.</p><p><em><em>Much time had been lost already, it was time to bring in the big guns.</em></em></p><p>Even as the team dodged obstacles and took detours, making the best use of available resources, Project Managers Sourabh Gupta and Sanchit Juneja had been communicating with other teams for backup.

Let’s take music as an example. It\nhelps to know the theory and to understand the mechanics of your instrument. It\nalso helps to have talent. Having a good partner to watch your back doesn’t hurt\neither. But there’s more to it.\n\nWhy are The Beatles [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles], who formed in\nLiverpool in 1960, considered one of the greatest bands in history\n[https://www.quora.com/Why-are-The-Beatles-the-greatest-band-in-history/answer/Giliana-P-Garc%C3%ADa-Acevedo-1]\n? Why doesn’t everyone else achieve the same level of success?\n\n> The difference between master and beginner is the amount of practice.\nThe Beatles applied the fundamentals they learned over and over again, using\nfeedback to get better every time. All told, they performed for 270 nights in\njust over a year-and-a-half. By the time they had their first taste of success\nin 1964, they had performed live an estimated 1,200 times. Most bands today\ndon’t perform that much in their entire career.\n\nThe 10,000 Hours rule\nIn the early 1990s, psychologist K. Anders Ericsson and two of his colleagues at\nBerlin’s elite Academy of Music conducted a study\n[http://projects.ict.usc.edu/itw/gel/EricssonDeliberatePracticePR93.PDF]. With\nthe help of the Academy, they interviewed twelve expert pianists (8 men and 4\nwomen) and 12 amateurs (7 men and 5 women).\n\nThe amateurs never practiced more than about three hours a week over the course\nof their childhood, and by the age of twenty, they had totaled two thousand\nhours of practice. The experts, on the other hand, steadily increased their\npractice time every year, until by the age of twenty, they had reached ten\nthousand hours.\n\n> “To become a chess grandmaster also seems to take about ten years. (Only the\nlegendary Bobby Fisher got to that elite level in less than that amount of time:\nit took him nine years.) And what’s ten years? Well, it’s roughly how long it\ntakes to put in ten thousand hours of hard practice. Ten thousand hours is the\nmagic number of greatness.”\n> Malcolm Gladwell, in his book “Outliers: The Story of Success\n[http://amzn.to/wgo1hw]”\nThe interesting thing about that number, of course, is that ten thousand hours\nis an enormous amount of time. It’s all but impossible to reach that number all\nby yourself by the time you’re a young adult. This would require encouraging\nparents and some measure of wealth, which would avoid the need to hold down\nadditional jobs that would eat into valuable practice time.\n\nWhat Happens in the Software Industry\nIn the software industry, we take developers trained in theory and throw them\nstraight into the deep-end, working on a project with no real precedent to draw\nfrom. It’s like taking a group of kids to fight against the big gang in the\ntown. But that is not an issue because, in software engineering, we do our\npracticing on the job, and that’s why we make mistakes on the job. But at the\nend of the day, we want to be great while still managing the objectives. For\nthat purpose, we need to find ways of splitting the practice from the\nprofession. A practice method that is effective and without taking up too much\ntime.\n\n> This is where CodeKata comes in.\nThe CodeKata\nKata [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kata] is an exercise in Karate to execute a\nspecified series of a variety of moves, with stepping and turning, while\nattempting to maintain perfect form. It teaches the student about proper form\nand position to helped them visualize different scenarios for each motion and\ntechnique. Traditionally, kata is taught in stages. Previously learned kata are\nrepeated to show better technique or power as a student acquires knowledge and\nexperience. It is common for students to repeat every kata they have learned but\nat an improved level of quality.\n\nSandy Vs. SpongebobCodeKata is an attempt to bring this element of practice to software\ndevelopment. The intent behind CodeKata is similar to Karate Kata. Each is a\nshort exercise. It repeated multiple times, adding little improvements in each\ncycle. Some involve programming and can be coded in many different ways. Some\ninvolve thinking about the issues behind programming and design. These are\nunlikely to have a single correct answer.\n\n> Remember that the point of the kata is not arriving at the correct answer. The\npoint is the stuff you learn along the way. The goal is the practice, not the\nsolution.\nHow Is This Accomplished at Gojek?\nAt Gojek, there’s a program for employees called Engineering Bootcamp\n[https://blog.gojekengineering.com/what-is-the-go-jek-engineering-bootcamp-de7778836da9]\n. Basically, it is weeks of intense hands-on learning designed to unlearn and\nequip skills needed to be a world-class engineer.\n\nCore Engineering BootcampAt Bootcamp, the way coaches taught us (participants)\nis similar to CodeKata. We have a code drill session in the afternoon to solve\none problem by using Java. After the class ends, we solve the same problem again\nas homework in the evening using Ruby. There are many things we did in our code\ndrill session, that really helped us develop in CodeKata. Those are:\n\n1. Set Rules\nWe have rules called Non-Negotiable Etiquette. If you violate one of the rules,\nyou have to rm -rf your code and start it again from scratch. What is rm -rf? It\nis a basic command on Unix system to remove files or directories from the\nmachine forever.\n\nNon Negotiable Etiquette\nIf you violate one, rm -rf! never love your code </3\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n 1.  Indentation and spacing between code constructs (classes/methods/specs)\n     must be consistent.\n 2.  Use only spaces (no tabs) for indentation.\n 3.  Newlines at end of file.\n 4.  Follow accepted naming conventions for your language/framework.\n 5.  Follow accepted naming file and Directory structure for your\n     language/framework.\n 6.  Use namespaces.\n 7.  No comments/Unused Code/Unused file/Unused folder must ever be checked in.\n 8.  Runtime environment should be consistent with IDE environment -  i.e there\n     should be no difference in running a build or a spec from your IDE and from\n     the command line.\n 9.  Use .gitignore.\n 10. Ensure there is a README.md that includes problem description, dev\n     environment setup, build instructions, and run instructions.\n 11. Test Driven Development (this should show in clear pattern in the commit\n     log - one spec, one code change per commit)\n\nCan you imagine the feeling when code that we wrote with blood and tears needs\nto be deleted for one small mistake? Is that acceptable?\n\n> Yes, you must not love your code.\nThat small mistake is not tolerable in production and even development. It could\ncause bugs, errors or other things that may become a bottleneck. But of course,\nwe don’t rm -rf in work 😂. It’s just a practice so that we don’t get overly\nattached to the code, remain careful about mistakes, and most importantly —\nmaintain quality.\n\n2. Practise Pair Programming\nAs the name implies, pair programming is where two developers work on one\nmachine. We only have a keyboard and a mouse for each pair. One developer acts\nas the driver who codes while the other serves as the observer who checks the\ncode being written, proofreads and spell-checks, and also figures out where to\ngo next. These roles can be switched at any time: the driver will then become\nthe observer and vice versa.\n\nPair Programming greatly helps us in CodeKata, because:\n\n * It’s harder to procrastinate. Working as a team means you can’t stop and\n   check your email, Slack, Facebook or WhatsApp every few minutes.\n * When someone shares a problem you are going through, you feel less defeated\n   and more positive about trying again.\n * Increases software quality without impacting much on time to deliver. It will\n   cost only 15% of the development time according to this study\n   [https://www.economist.com/technology-quarterly/2001/09/20/agility-counts].\n   But with increased quality comes big savings later in the project.\n\n3. Have a Short Cycle\nThe point of CodeKata is to get experience from practice. In order to achieve\nthat, we solve the same problem multiple times. We try different approaches and\nsolutions to experience each advantage and disadvantage. While we work on it, we\nalso try to add little improvements for every cycle. But sometimes, we can also\ntreat the cycle as an iteration of solving the problem.\n\nBecause CodeKata is a practicing method and not project development. It’s not\nsupposed to be worked on for the long run. For that reason, we only have 20–30\nmins for every cycle (sometimes even shorter).\n\nAfter the Mini Retro, we showcase our code to other participants in the class.\nWhy do we need to do it? Even though the whole class is working on the same\nproblem, we may interpret it differently and have hundreds of possible different\nsolutions. Doing a showcase will tell others about progress and approaches. It\nwill trigger a discussion and synchronize the context for everyone. At the end\nof the day, we will converge at the current best solution.\n\n> It’s similar to Agile Development. You deliver something to the customer as soon\nas possible to get feedback faster.\nA Few Final Thoughts\nMy tips for CodeKata are:\n\n * Find a place and time where you won’t be interrupted.\n * Focus on the essential elements of the Kata.\n * Remember to look for feedback for every major decision\n * If it helps, keep a journal of your progress\n * Have discussion groups with other developers, but try to have completed the\n   kata first\n\nCore Engineering BootcampThank you for reading this blog!

Why doesn’t everyone else achieve the same level of success?</p><blockquote>The difference between master and beginner is the amount of practice.</blockquote><p>The Beatles applied the fundamentals they learned over and over again, using feedback to get better every time. All told, they performed for 270 nights in just over a year-and-a-half. By the time they had their first taste of success in 1964, they had performed live an estimated 1,200 times. Most bands today don’t perform that much in their entire career.</p><h3 id=\"the-10-000-hours-rule\">The 10,000 Hours rule</h3><p>In the early 1990s, psychologist K. Anders Ericsson and two of his colleagues at Berlin’s elite Academy of Music conducted a <a href=\"http://projects.ict.usc.edu/itw/gel/EricssonDeliberatePracticePR93.PDF\" rel=\"noopener\">study</a>. With the help of the Academy, they interviewed twelve expert pianists (8 men and 4 women) and 12 amateurs (7 men and 5 women).</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/912/1*XesRz3d5FMCzIOfm7Yk3hA.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>The amateurs never practiced more than about three hours a week over the course of their childhood, and by the age of twenty, they had totaled two thousand hours of practice. The experts, on the other hand, steadily increased their practice time every year, until by the age of twenty, they had reached ten thousand hours.</p><blockquote><em><em>“To become a chess grandmaster also seems to take about ten years. (Only the legendary Bobby Fisher got to that elite level in less than that amount of time: it took him nine years.) And what’s ten years? Well, it’s roughly how long it takes to put in ten thousand hours of hard practice. <strong><strong>Ten thousand hours</strong></strong> is the magic number of greatness.”</em></em></blockquote><blockquote><em><em>Malcolm Gladwell, in his book “<a href=\"http://amzn.to/wgo1hw\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Outliers: The Story of Success</em></a><em>”</em></em></em></blockquote><p>The interesting thing about that number, of course, is that ten thousand hours is an enormous amount of time. It’s all but impossible to reach that number all by yourself by the time you’re a young adult. This would require encouraging parents and some measure of wealth, which would avoid the need to hold down additional jobs that would eat into valuable practice time.</p><h3 id=\"what-happens-in-the-software-industry\">What Happens in the Software Industry</h3><p>In the software industry, we take developers trained in theory and throw them straight into the deep-end, working on a project with no real precedent to draw from. It’s like taking a group of kids to fight against the big gang in the town. But that is not an issue because, in software engineering, we do our practicing on the job, and that’s why we make mistakes on the job. But at the end of the day, we want to be great while still managing the objectives. For that purpose, we need to find ways of splitting the practice from the profession. A practice method that is effective and without taking up too much time.</p><blockquote><em><em>This is where CodeKata comes in.</em></em></blockquote><h3 id=\"the-codekata\">The CodeKata</h3><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kata\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong><strong>Kata</strong></strong></a> is an exercise in Karate to execute a specified series of a variety of moves, with stepping and turning, while attempting to maintain perfect form. It teaches the student about proper form and position to helped them visualize different scenarios for each motion and technique. Traditionally, kata is taught in stages. Previously learned kata are repeated to show better technique or power as a student acquires knowledge and experience. It is common for students to repeat every kata they have learned but at an improved level of quality.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/670/1*icPku4JdhwTHMvyV7uPLZw.gif\" class=\"kg-image\"><figcaption>Sandy Vs. Spongebob</figcaption></figure><p><strong><strong>CodeKata</strong></strong> is an attempt to bring this element of practice to software development. The intent behind CodeKata is similar to Karate Kata. Each is a short exercise. It repeated multiple times, adding little improvements in each cycle. Some involve programming and can be coded in many different ways. Some involve thinking about the issues behind programming and design. These are unlikely to have a single correct answer.</p><blockquote>Remember that the point of the kata is not arriving at the correct answer. The point is the stuff you learn along the way. The goal is the practice, not the solution.</blockquote><h3 id=\"how-is-this-accomplished-at-gojek\">How Is This Accomplished at Gojek?</h3><p>At Gojek, there’s a program for employees called <a href=\"https://blog.gojekengineering.com/what-is-the-go-jek-engineering-bootcamp-de7778836da9\" rel=\"noopener\">Engineering Bootcamp</a>. Basically, it is weeks of intense hands-on learning designed to unlearn and equip skills needed to be a world-class engineer.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/3840/1*uo6NJ-s_43bjcY2V_JDSPQ.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\"><figcaption>Core Engineering Bootcamp</figcaption></figure><p>At Bootcamp, the way coaches taught us (participants) is similar to CodeKata. We have a code drill session in the afternoon to solve one problem by using Java. After the class ends, we solve the same problem again as homework in the evening using Ruby. There are many things we did in our code drill session, that really helped us develop in CodeKata. Those are:</p><h3 id=\"1-set-rules\">1. Set Rules</h3><p>We have rules called <strong><strong>Non-Negotiable Etiquette</strong></strong>. If you violate one of the rules, you have to <em><em>rm -rf</em></em> your code and start it again from scratch. What is <em><em>rm -rf</em></em>? It is a basic command on Unix system to remove files or directories from the machine forever.</p><h3 id=\"non-negotiable-etiquette\">Non Negotiable Etiquette</h3><p>If you violate one, rm -rf! never love your code &lt;/3</p><hr><ol><li>Indentation and spacing between code constructs (classes/methods/specs) must be consistent.</li><li>Use only spaces (no tabs) for indentation.</li><li>Newlines at end of file.</li><li>Follow accepted naming conventions for your language/framework.</li><li>Follow accepted naming file and Directory structure for your language/framework.</li><li>Use namespaces.</li><li>No comments/Unused Code/Unused file/Unused folder must ever be checked in.</li><li>Runtime environment should be consistent with IDE environment -  i.e there should be no difference in running a build or a spec from your IDE and from the command line.</li><li>Use .gitignore.</li><li>Ensure there is a README.md that includes problem description, dev environment setup, build instructions, and run instructions.</li><li>Test Driven Development (this should show in clear pattern in the commit log - one spec, one code change per commit)</li></ol><p>Can you imagine the feeling when code that we wrote with blood and tears needs to be deleted for one small mistake? Is that acceptable?</p><blockquote>Yes, you must not love your code.</blockquote><p>That small mistake is not tolerable in production and even development. It could cause bugs, errors or other things that may become a bottleneck. But of course, we don’t <em><em>rm -rf</em></em> in work 😂. It’s just a practice so that we don’t get overly attached to the code, remain careful about mistakes, and most importantly — maintain quality.</p><h3 id=\"2-practise-pair-programming\">2. Practise Pair Programming</h3><p>As the name implies, pair programming is where two developers work on one machine. We only have a keyboard and a mouse for each pair. One developer acts as the driver who codes while the other serves as the observer who checks the code being written, proofreads and spell-checks, and also figures out where to go next. These roles can be switched at any time: the driver will then become the observer and vice versa.</p><p>Pair Programming greatly helps us in CodeKata, because:</p><ul><li>It’s harder to procrastinate. Working as a team means you can’t stop and check your email, Slack, Facebook or WhatsApp every few minutes.</li><li>When someone shares a problem you are going through, you feel less defeated and more positive about trying again.</li><li>Increases software quality without impacting much on time to deliver. It will cost only 15% of the development time according to this <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/technology-quarterly/2001/09/20/agility-counts\" rel=\"noopener\">study</a>. But with increased quality comes big savings later in the project.</li></ul><h3 id=\"3-have-a-short-cycle\">3. Have a Short Cycle</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/982/1*14PeUCfZheM8mK7xm6FL8w.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>The point of CodeKata is to get experience from practice. In order to achieve that, we solve the same problem multiple times. We try different approaches and solutions to experience each advantage and disadvantage. While we work on it, we also try to add little improvements for every cycle. But sometimes, we can also treat the cycle as an iteration of solving the problem.</p><p>Because CodeKata is a practicing method and not project development. It’s not supposed to be worked on for the long run. For that reason, we only have 20–30 mins for every cycle (sometimes even shorter).</p><p>After the Mini Retro, we showcase our code to other participants in the class. Why do we need to do it? Even though the whole class is working on the same problem, we may interpret it differently and have hundreds of possible different solutions. Doing a showcase will tell others about progress and approaches. It will trigger a discussion and synchronize the context for everyone. At the end of the day, we will converge at the current best solution.</p><blockquote>It’s similar to Agile Development. You deliver something to the customer as soon as possible to get feedback faster.</blockquote><h3 id=\"a-few-final-thoughts\">A Few Final Thoughts</h3><p>My tips for CodeKata are:</p><ul><li>Find a place and time where you won’t be interrupted.</li><li>Focus on the essential elements of the Kata.</li><li>Remember to look for feedback for every major decision</li><li>If it helps, keep a journal of your progress</li><li>Have discussion groups with other developers, but try to have completed the kata first</li></ul><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/4240/1*53r0Npq_Thb0R0saRF08Rg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\"><figcaption>Core Engineering Bootcamp</figcaption></figure><p>Thank you for reading this blog!

As the Summer\nPlacements semester got going in full swing, I decided to pursue an internship\nin the Product Management domain.\n\nWhen someone asked me: “Which is your dream company?”, I was not sure. I\nrealised that although there were renowned names coming on campus, for some\nreason, I wanted something more exciting.\n\nAfter days of pondering, I decided to apply off campus. A list was compiled, and\nthe options trickled down to three: Google, LinkedIn and Gojek! Thankfully,\nGojek had a PM internship opening. I applied, interviews went well and I was\nextended an offer at the Bangalore office.\n\nChapter 1: Documentation\n1st April 2019\n\nI reached the office full of enthusiasm, ready to make a mark of my own. The\nwhole day went in different formalities and it was almost evening when I got to\nmeet my team. To my surprise, by the end of the day, I was part of all relevant\ncommunication channels, team drives and had clarity on what I would work on for\nthe next four weeks.\n\nI just loved the agility shown by my manager to enable me to embark on my\njourney. In the process, I also realised why my undergrad friends working at\nGojek used to say that if you love speed, this is the place to be.\n\nThe next few days were spent understanding the product, people, and culture. I\nwas surprised by the volume and quality of the documentation done at the\ncompany. For a company which prides itself in being one of the fastest growing\nstartups in the world, this kind of emphasis on documentation was something\nunheard of. And because of these hundreds of beautifully crafted documents, by\nthe end of the first week itself, I was participating in their BAU (Business As\nUsual) meetings. (How many interns can claim this? 😜)\n\nChapter 2: Reading\n15th April 2019\n\nI was no longer a newbie in the company. I was having 1:1s with different\nstakeholders, attending IPMs (Internal Planning Meetings), BAU meetings and\nworking tirelessly on my dedicated projects.\n\nDuring the course of these all, one day I reached out to my mentor for\nsuggestions on how to prioritise among different features. This was his\nresponse:\n\n> “Read Abhishek, Read. What differentiates a good Product Manager from an average\none is his/her willingness to learn, and reading is the first and most important\nstep there.”\nHe gave me different links to read, (37 to be precise) which ranged from Product\nPrioritization, Product Design, Product Critique, Design Heuristics and even the\nPsychology involved in product success. As I pored through them, I realised\nProduct Management is not as random as it seems from outside. In fact, it is a\nfine cocktail of art and science mixed in just the right proportion.\n\nChapter 3: Inclusion\n23rd April 2019\n\nBy this point, I had completed my first project, got positive feedback, and was\nabout to finish the second. In the meantime, being a part of so many BAU\nmeetings had boosted my confidence and now I was chipping in with suggestions.\n\nDuring one such meetings, I raised a point in contradiction to what the other\nteam was saying. I tried to explain my point of view but we were not able to\ncome to an agreement. When I came out, I realised that I should have dealt with\nthe situation differently. I went to my mentor and explained as much.\n\n> To this, he said: “Sometimes it’s not only about how you or your team is looking\nat things. You also have to look at what is the value proposition of other teams\ninvolved”\nThis was the second important lesson which I learnt: being a PM your job is to\nfirst bring everyone at the table to a common ground before pushing any agenda. \nWhether it is inter-team or intra-team, to get the job done, you have to bring\npeople to your side by understanding what they want and why they want it.\n\nChapter 4: Relevance\n30th April 2019\n\nI had just finished my second project when I met a senior engineer while passing\nthrough the pantry area. He asked how it’s going and what I was working on. I,\nwith full excitement, told him many ideas I came up with.\n\nAnd then he said: “Man, it doesn’t matter how cool the ideas are or how great\nthey sound. Judge them on their relevance. Are they correctly solving the\nproblem intended? Are they adding value to the lives of relevant stakeholders?”\nAnd then he gave me a set of 10 similar questions and said that if after\nanswering these 10 questions, you still believe you should implement the idea, \nthen it matters.\n\nChapter 5: Impact\n7th May 2019\n\nI had started understanding the nitty-gritty of product management and was\nraring to pick a more challenging project. And then I got this mail from my\nmanager:\n\nReally??? After such nice product & strategy based projects, this is what you\nwant me to do!!\n\n> But again, that was my inexperience talking.\nDuring the course of the next week, I learnt one more valuable lesson: “Look at\nthe impact of your work, not how cool it sounds. Being a PM, the world is your\ndomain and processes are as important as the product itself. If you want your\nproduct to succeed, you need to oil the whole machinery.”\n\nRecently, I came to know that a senior PM found the document to be super good\nand now it is being used across the substreams to onboard new hires. (I’m\nallowed one humblebrag right? 😅)\n\nChapter 6: Communication\n21st May 2019\n\nThe changing weather of Bangalore had hit me hard and I had to take a leave\nowing to ill health. I sent a message each to my manager and mentor regarding\nthe same. My mentor replied asking me to inform the whole team, which I missed\nand read quite late. When I did, I figured I am an intern anyway, and don’t have\nany current projects with the team. Even if I don’t send the mail to them, it\ndoesn’t matter much.\n\nWhen I met my mentor the next day, he asked why I didn’t send the mail, and I\nexplained why. He said: “Abhishek, it doesn’t matter whether you have a current\nproject with the team or not. Being a PM, one of the most important skills is\nbeing very clear in communication. There might be situations where you wouldn’t\neven know and people would be waiting for you. Not only in this case, but in\nevery everything you do, a PM needs to be a clear and careful communicator.”\n\nChapter 7: Ownership\n24th May 2019\n\nMy internship was nearing it’s end, and I reached out to my mentor for some\nsuggestions on the last project I was working on. During our conversation, he\nasked if my previous one had gone live in production. I said no, but clarified\nthat my part is done and it is stuck on other collaborating teams.\n\nThat’s when I realised I had one last lesson left to learn:\n\n> “Being a PM it’s your job to get it from conception to production. If there are\nblockers, you have to proactively reach out to remove them. Being a PM is a\ntricky job, once you have dirtied your hand, the onus comes on you to get it to\ncompletion.”\n> “Once you have picked up something — It’s All Yours.”\nEpilogue\nToday, when I look back, my internship at Gojek was a short, but sweet journey\nwhich taught me many lessons. As I go back for my second year at IIMA, I am much\nmore confident when it comes to Product Management.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSpecial thanks to my manager Vikrama Dhiman, my mentor Manas J Saloi, Shobhit\nSrivastava, and all the members of the Transport team who were always ready to\nhelp me during the course of my journey.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWant more updates on how we build scalable systems for Southeast Asia’s\n#SuperApp?

While that might seem outlandish, if\nyou’re a developer, you might just get what I mean. Think about it carefully; it\ncan repeat mundane tasks, making people more productive. It can solve complex\nproblems, so devs can focus on pressing tasks.\n\nHowever, it can also complicate culture; like introducing a biometric system to\ntrack employee attendance, and have software track sick leaves.\n\n> In essence, an organisation’s tech stack will reflect the health of the company.\nIf you’re focused on writing beautiful code, it’s likely that employees are\ndisciplined, organised, and believe in the company’s values. It’s really not\nthat far-fetched a correlation.\n\nThis is a similar story; the story of Kafka — an open source tool that solved\nculture for us. Will try and simplify this for a broad audience, so devs, please\nbear with me if some explanations seem obvious and trite.\n\nBefore the Law — Chaos\nIn late 2015, unprecedented scale and failures were routine at Gojek. It also\nweighed heavily on culture\n[https://blog.gojekengineering.com/failures-make-us-stronger-part-2-a325cae09f20] \n— because firefighting when systems are down bogs down morale and creates a\nfractious lot. It was truly Kafkaesque. (See what I did there? 😉). These\nfractures were common in our early days, because all developers depended on our\ncore systems.\n\nWe had about 10+ products at the time and about 60+ developers (Today, we have\n18+ products with 250+ developers overseeing them). These 60 passionate devs saw\nthe chance to build products, solve complex problems and moved fast to meet\nrapacious demand. Naturally, people were doing their own work, writing code in\ntheir own style, and had to sync with others to deploy what they wrote.\n\nAt the core of Gojek is ‘Allocations\n[https://blog.gojekengineering.com/how-go-jek-manages-1-million-drivers-with-12-engineers-part-1-978af9ccfd32]\n’; — a classic matchmaking engine between the driver and the customer. All\nsurrounding teams depended on this one team to add features, beta test their\nofferings, and much more. If GO-FOOD wanted to allocate a 4-star driver to some\norders, they had to raise a ‘ticket’ with the Allocations team. The Allocations\nteam then processed this for GO-FOOD.\n\nNow, think of 50 developers asking Allocations to push their features first.\n\nSoon, the org was heavily dependent on relationships. If Ekta from GO-BOX had a\nstrong relationship with Jane in Allocations, Ekta would get preference on her\nfeatures. This became problematic for us and as the org scaled, it added more\ncultural biases. Jane also became the defacto gatekeeper. Everyone had to toe\nher line if they wanted to build and deploy their own features. To add to this,\nAllocations was pushing back and severely lagging behind, because 50-odd\ndevelopers were adding and testing 10 features a day.\n\nBefore you knew it, Allocations became the bottleneck to scale the org. As if\nall that wasn’t enough, the team was not doing its own testing and experiments\nto make Allocations better and sharper. Things were spiralling downwards.\n\nA patch would not do, we needed a fix\nIt was apparent we had to fix this problem — once and for all. The \n‘Relationship-as-a-Service’ model was a disaster. RaaS was endemic in the org.\nThings were fine at a macro level, but at the base of it, we were failing.\n\nWe needed a solution that gave everyone the freedom to build and experiment. We\nwanted folks to think they’re building individual products from scratch without\nany reliance. Easier said that done, right?\n\n> This was the genesis of Gojek’s philosophy of building a #SuperApp — a chance to\nbuild startups within a startup.\nWe wanted to unleash our best minds to build, and not worry about RaaS.After\nsome research and consensus across the board, we were all sold on Kafka. \nSoftware was going to solve our RaaS problem. Ambitious? Maybe. Pragmatic? Damn\nright.\n\nForget the morose writer\nEvery team was mandated to broadcast events on Kafka. If a driver booking was\nmade, it was sent to Kafka. If a driver completed the ride, it was sent to\nKafka. Kafka became the bus that carried the millions of events happening inside\nGojek.\n\n> Anything and everything individual teams did was visible to anyone and everyone\ninside Gojek.\nIf a team wanted to test features or roll out updates, they merely had to rely\non Kafka. No more RaaS. No more long waiting periods. This unleashed the\nproductivity of every developer. The day we rolled out Kafka, we killed the\ngatekeeper. Information was free and accessible to all. We were solving software\nproblems, but deep down, culture was the bigger fix.\n\n> Today, we emit 350,000,000 messages on Kafka and it’s every engineers’\nplayground.\nOur two-pizza team rule became far more efficient, and now we were solving\nbigger problems. This is also an example of how we look at Lean Engineering, but\nthat’s a story for another day.\n\nDas Urteil — But positive Metamorphosis\n‘Das Urteil’ means ‘The Judgement’, and Franz Kafka published this book in 1913.\nMetamorphosis was published in 1915. The latter talks about how a salesman\nturned into an insect and struggles to live. It’s classic Franz Kafka; deeply\nsad, complex and incredibly gut-wrenching.\n\nIn our case, The Judgement was of an insect metamorphosing into a butterfly. It\ndidn’t happen overnight, but this was our tipping point. Our tech stack began to\nreflect organisation culture.\n\nKafka solved a critical cultural problem for us. 💪\n\nLiked what you read?

Naturally, people were doing their own work, <strong><strong>writing code in their own style,</strong></strong> and had to sync with others to deploy what they wrote.</p><p>At the core of Gojek is ‘<a href=\"https://blog.gojekengineering.com/how-go-jek-manages-1-million-drivers-with-12-engineers-part-1-978af9ccfd32\" rel=\"noopener\">Allocations</a>’; — a classic matchmaking engine between the driver and the customer. All surrounding teams depended on this one team to add features, beta test their offerings, and much more. If GO-FOOD wanted to allocate a 4-star driver to some orders, they had to raise a ‘ticket’ with the Allocations team. The Allocations team then processed this for GO-FOOD.</p><p><em><em>Now, think of 50 developers asking Allocations to push their features first.</em></em></p><p>Soon, the org was heavily dependent on relationships. If Ekta from GO-BOX had a strong relationship with Jane in Allocations, Ekta would get preference on her features. This became problematic for us and as the org scaled, it added more cultural biases. <strong><strong>Jane also became the defacto gatekeeper.</strong> </strong>Everyone had to toe her line if they wanted to build and deploy their own features. To add to this, Allocations was pushing back and severely lagging behind, because 50-odd developers were adding and testing 10 features a day.</p><p>Before you knew it, <strong><strong>Allocations became the bottleneck to scale the org. </strong></strong>As if all that wasn’t enough, the team was not doing its own testing and experiments to make Allocations better and sharper. Things were spiralling downwards.</p><h3 id=\"a-patch-would-not-do-we-needed-a-fix\">A patch would not do, we needed a fix</h3><p>It was apparent we had to fix this problem — once and for all. The <strong><strong>‘Relationship-as-a-Service’</strong></strong> model was a disaster. <strong><strong>RaaS</strong></strong> was endemic in the org. Things were fine at a macro level, but at the base of it, we were failing.</p><p>We needed a solution that gave everyone the freedom to build and experiment. We wanted folks to think they’re building individual products from scratch without any reliance. <strong><strong>Easier said that done, right?</strong></strong></p><blockquote>This was the genesis of Gojek’s philosophy of building a #SuperApp — a chance to build startups within a startup.</blockquote><p>We wanted to unleash our best minds to build, and not worry about <strong><strong>RaaS.</strong></strong>After some research and consensus across the board, we were all sold on Kafka.<strong><strong> Software was going to solve our RaaS problem. Ambitious? Maybe. Pragmatic? Damn right</strong></strong>.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://gojek-ghost.zysk.in/content/images/2020/06/1_TKa_fTjcIPBZr71sSMTaFA.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><h3 id=\"forget-the-morose-writer\">Forget the morose writer</h3><p>Every team was mandated to broadcast events on Kafka. If a driver booking was made, it was sent to Kafka. If a driver completed the ride, it was sent to Kafka. Kafka became the bus that carried the millions of events happening inside Gojek.</p><blockquote>Anything and everything individual teams did was visible to anyone and everyone inside Gojek.</blockquote><p>If a team wanted to test features or roll out updates, they merely had to rely on Kafka. No more RaaS<strong><strong>.</strong></strong> No more long waiting periods. This unleashed the productivity of every developer. <strong><strong>The day we rolled out Kafka, we killed the gatekeeper. Information was free and accessible to all. </strong></strong>We were solving software problems, but deep down, culture was the bigger fix.</p><blockquote>Today, we emit 350,000,000 messages on Kafka and it’s every engineers’ playground.</blockquote><p>Our two-pizza team rule became far more efficient, and now we were solving bigger problems. This is also an example of how we look at Lean Engineering, but that’s a story for another day.</p><h3 id=\"das-urteil-but-positive-metamorphosis\">Das Urteil — But positive Metamorphosis</h3><p>‘Das Urteil’ means ‘The Judgement’, and Franz Kafka published this book in 1913. Metamorphosis was published in 1915. The latter talks about how a salesman turned into an insect and struggles to live. It’s classic Franz Kafka; deeply sad, complex and incredibly gut-wrenching.</p><p>In our case, The Judgement was of an insect metamorphosing into a butterfly. It didn’t happen overnight, but this was our tipping point. Our tech stack began to reflect organisation culture.</p><p><strong><strong>Kafka solved a critical cultural problem for us.</strong></strong> 💪</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://gojek-ghost.zysk.in/content/images/2020/06/1_Yigf1nGxRKjzV7vIC_YkYg.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>Liked what you read?

Nadiem, Andre and Kevin have been\nrunning the business together for a number of years, which will ensure that this\nleadership transition will run smoothly.\n\nNadiem’s news was communicated in an email to all Gojek staff that was sent\ntoday. In the email, he looked back on how the company has grown over the past\nnine years and also set out his hopes for the future of the business:\n\n“We started this company with nothing, other than a deep desire to change things\nfor the better. We saw that the streets of Jakarta were a mess and that there\nwas an informal community of ojek drivers who could easily act as a huge part of\nthe solution to that mess, if only they were organised and working efficiently.\n\n“With just that initial desire to improve life for everyone, as well as a large\namount of support from countless friends, partners and stakeholders, we’ve\ncreated Gojek. An iconic company that flies the flag for the future of Indonesia\nand Southeast Asia.\n\n“I will leave Gojek in the capable hands of Andre Soelistyo and Kevin Aluwi as\nco-CEOs, both of whom have played central roles in moving the company along its\npath from that office in South Jakarta onto the global stage.\n\n“We got very lucky as we progressed along that path, but I believe that luck in\nbusiness only really becomes a valuable commodity if you have the brilliant\nminds needed to take advantage of it. Kevin and Andre have mentored me to be the\nleader I am today. They are quite simply Gojek’s best. They have been running\nthis company for a number of years and I have complete faith not just in their\ntechnical skills and ability to execute flawlessly, but also in their integrity\nand their desire to do the right thing every step of the way.\n\n“High emotions are involved in running a company like Gojek but Andre and Kevin\nare always the steady voices of reason, approaching problems with intelligence\nand compassion. I couldn’t ask for better successors as the Gojek movement\nbegins its next stage of growth.”\n\nA joint statement released by Andre and Kevin said: “When a friend and mentor\nleaves a business you have built together, there is always going to be some\nsadness, but we are both determined that Gojek will go from strength to\nstrength. We will continue to implement our vision as we focus on what the Gojek\nof the next ten years is going to be like.\n\n“This company has changed the lives of so many people in Indonesia and around\nthe region, and our key priority is to ensure that we can continue to act as a\npositive force in society for the foreseeable future.”\n\nUnder Andre and Kevin’s management, Gojek has grown exponentially, to process\nover two billion transactions a year. The company’s fundraising efforts have\nattracted some of the world’s most exciting companies including Google, Tencent,\nMitsubishi, Visa, AIA and Astra, with Series F set to raise well over US$2bn.\nThe company has also launched operations in Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam,\nwhile the Gojek app has become the most-used on-demand application in Indonesia,\nwhere its food and payments businesses have overtaken transport to become the\nlargest businesses within the group.\n\nWith the new structure, Andre will focus on corporate functions and management\nof capital allocation, international expansion as well as the payments and\nfinancial services businesses, while Kevin will focus on the product development\nelements of the Gojek business as well as marketing, organisational development\nand the transportation and food delivery businesses.\n\nSince co-founding Gojek, Kevin has held significant leadership roles across\nproduct and functional teams within the organisation. He has used his background\nin Business Intelligence to pioneer the use of data for decision-making across\nthe Gojek business. He has also assembled deep technology expertise across the\ndata, engineering and product teams, with a focus on enhancing the platform’s\noverall user experience. Prior to his role at Gojek, Kevin spent time at Zalora\nIndonesia, Merah Putih Incubator and Salem Partners.\n\nSimilarly, Andre has played a pivotal role in laying a solid foundation for\nGojek’s rapid growth. He has overseen over US$4bn of fundraising, which\nattracted key investors such as Google, Tencent, Astra, KKR and Warburg Pincus.\nHe has also laid the foundation for the company’s business strategy for long\nterm sustainability.

We have looked at multiple ways to expand our operations and concluded\nthat Gurgaon is a logical destination to set up shop, not least because of the\namazing talent we have found in the area. GOJEK recorded an annualized Gross\nTransaction Value (GTV) of US$9 billion as of 2018, and the hyper-growth journey\nwe’ve been on demands talent who are willing to take risks, fail, learn and\ncontinue to scale a company that aims to solve everyday problems for Southeast\nAsia. With operations underway in Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam, we will now\nconsider whether further acquisitions are needed as we seek to bring in\nentrepreneurial teams who can help us further develop the multi-service business\nmodel that makes GOJEK a leader in Southeast Asia,” said Sidu Ponnappa, MD India\nat GOJEK.\n\nOn the acquisition of AirCTO, Sidu added, “I’m super thrilled to have AirCTO’s\ntalented team join us.

Finding quality talent is always a challenge, and Atif and\nteam are here to find technology-based solutions that will help us to overcome\nthis challenge.”\n\nAtif Haider, Founder, AirCTO, said, “At AirCTO we’ve focused on the pain points\ntechnology firms experience as they seek to find talent that fits their\nrequirements. We believe that recruiting as an industry needs a major upheaval,\nand we started AirCTO with this in mind. Over the past three years, we’ve helped\na range of startups and corporates source qualified candidates for critical\ntechnology roles. We were in talks with a number of other tech giants, but we\nfound GOJEK to be the best fit, as we share similar DNA — something that’s\nreally important for us. We intend to use our prowess in recruitment to\ncontribute to the hyper-growth GOJEK is currently experiencing across Southeast\nAsia.”\n\nLocated at DLF CyberHub, Gurgaon, the 18,000+ sq.ft office is equipped to seat\naround 150+ employees. The centre offers all amenities including a 24/7 office\nwith a cafeteria. The interiors reflect GOJEK’s signature combination of green\nand white with a touch of wood. The office will be a combination of open spaces,\nbreakout areas for discussions, meeting rooms and coder caves.\n\nThe GOJEK Bangalore office recently won an Institute of Indian Interior\nDesigners (IIID) award for the ‘Best Design’ category.\n\nAs part of the expansion, GOJEK’s largest India-based product team, GO-FOOD,\nwill setup product divisions in the Gurgaon office. GOJEK is the largest\nsingle-market food delivery app in the world outside of China. It is the largest\nfood delivery app in SoutheastAsia with over 400,000 merchants — 85% of these\nare small micro-entrepreneurs that rely heavily on GO-FOOD for revenue.\n\nWorking at GOJEK gives an opportunity to solve real challenges and transform\nlives across Southeast Asia.

The acquisition aligns with GOJEK’s focus on hiring premium talent to support the development of its ‘<a href=\"https://www.gojek.io/superapp/\" rel=\"noopener\">Super App</a>’. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.</p><p>The company has also announced the opening of a new office in Gurgaon, for which GOJEK plans to hire 100 employees aiming to reach a total headcount of 500 in India by the year-end. As part of its expansion plans, the company is also considering further acquisitions in India.</p><p><strong><strong>The Indonesian-headquartered company is actively interested in companies with complementary expertise in engineering, design and product management.</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>Quotes:</strong></strong></p><p>“Our investment in Gurgaon underlines our commitment to growing the GOJEK India story. We have looked at multiple ways to expand our operations and concluded that Gurgaon is a logical destination to set up shop, not least because of the amazing talent we have found in the area. GOJEK recorded an annualized Gross Transaction Value (GTV) of US$9 billion as of 2018, and the hyper-growth journey we’ve been on demands talent who are willing to take risks, fail, learn and continue to scale a company that aims to solve everyday problems for Southeast Asia. With operations underway in Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam, we will now consider whether further acquisitions are needed as we seek to bring in entrepreneurial teams who can help us further develop the multi-service business model that makes GOJEK a leader in Southeast Asia,” said <strong><strong>Sidu Ponnappa, MD India at GOJEK.</strong></strong></p><p>On the acquisition of AirCTO, <strong><strong>Sidu </strong></strong>added, “I’m super thrilled to have AirCTO’s talented team join us. The team will use technology to help us scale up our hiring processes. Finding quality talent is always a challenge, and Atif and team are here to find technology-based solutions that will help us to overcome this challenge.”</p><p><strong><strong>Atif Haider, Founder, AirCTO,</strong></strong> said, “At AirCTO we’ve focused on the pain points technology firms experience as they seek to find talent that fits their requirements. We believe that recruiting as an industry needs a major upheaval, and we started AirCTO with this in mind. Over the past three years, we’ve helped a range of startups and corporates source qualified candidates for critical technology roles. We were in talks with a number of other tech giants, but we found GOJEK to be the best fit, as we share similar DNA — something that’s really important for us. We intend to use our prowess in recruitment to contribute to the hyper-growth GOJEK is currently experiencing across Southeast Asia.”</p><p>Located at DLF CyberHub, Gurgaon, the 18,000+ sq.ft office is equipped to seat around 150+ employees. The centre offers all amenities including a 24/7 office with a cafeteria. The interiors reflect GOJEK’s signature combination of green and white with a touch of wood. The office will be a combination of open spaces, breakout areas for discussions, meeting rooms and coder caves.</p><p>The GOJEK Bangalore office recently won an Institute of Indian Interior Designers (IIID) award for the ‘Best Design’ category.</p><p>As part of the expansion, GOJEK’s largest India-based product team, GO-FOOD, will setup product divisions in the Gurgaon office. GOJEK is the largest single-market food delivery app in the world outside of China. It is the largest food delivery app in SoutheastAsia with over 400,000 merchants — 85% of these are small micro-entrepreneurs that rely heavily on GO-FOOD for revenue.</p><p>Working at GOJEK gives an opportunity to solve real challenges and transform lives across Southeast Asia.
