The What\nWhen something fails, it is important to understand the origin of the problem.\nEvery team in Gojek sets up alerts which monitor the state of their systems.

The idea is to give driver partners\nenough information to make the decision to accept the trip. But there was a\nproblem.\n\n2.

The Fallout\nDrivers being unable to use the app means they can‚Äôt accept bookings.

Pager duty is hit, and cell phones\nstart ringing off their proverbial hooks.\n\nWith driver partners stuck with malfunctioning apps, multiple Gojek services\nstart reporting errors. As customers try and figure out why the app is behaving\nthis way, engineers scramble to do the same.\n\n4. The Response\nWhen the phones ring, the team whose alerts have been triggered immediately get\nto work figuring out what happened. If they identify the problem quickly and\ndebug it, they notify other teams. The team then gets to work using information\nfrom the alerts and system dashboards to prepare an RCA.\n\nThis is, of course, the best case scenario.\n\nIf the concerned team cannot find a fix however, a war room is called.\n\nThe war room signifies a larger issue, and members of every available team drop\nwhat they‚Äôre doing and join the call. Sometimes, these are frantic Slack\ndiscussions and calls in the middle of the night. Other times, office boardrooms\nare blocked and everyone gathers to brainstorm collectively.\n\nDevs, Team Leads, Product Managers, all hands on deck.\n\nIn a war room scenario, whoever has most context on the situation takes charge\nand delegates tasks as required. This central person also plays a key role in\ndocumenting the happenings in the war room ‚Äî how many people were present, which\nteams were represented, who was handling what, etc. All this information plays a\nkey role in the RCA. While this is going down, Driver and Customer Care centres\nare also notified, bracing for the inevitable flurry of complaints.\n\nThe fix may take the form of a few simple temporary hacks, or an hours long war\nroom ‚Äî but in the end, there is always a fix.\n\nWords of appreciation from GoPay CEO Aldi Haryopratomo and Gojek CTO Ajey Gore\nAnd a sense of camaraderie üíö\n\nOnce the dust settles, the investigation begins.

The Learnings\n‚ÄúCollaborate With Compassion‚Äù\n\nThese three words mean a lot at Gojek, and our RCAs reflect that. When you open\nan RCA mail, there is rarely even a mention of specific people, except to\nacknowledge those who responded to the distress call and played a role in\nfinding a fix.

Voila!! You got a driver. That was\nfast. You can see your driver‚Äôs location on the map, and the estimated time they\nwould take to come to you.\n\nBut hang on‚Ä¶ It seems like the map is a bit messed up.\n\nThe driver location on the map goes back and forth at unreal speed, and even\nflies over buildings. Starring in an action movie is not exactly how you want to\nstart your week. üòÆ\n\nWhile our driver-partners sure are superman in their own unique way, they\ncertainly can‚Äôt drive over buildings. This is clearly not how your driver is\nactually driving on the road. But then why is the map showing all this?\n\nWell, there are multiple factors that can lead to a bad experience like that.\nSome within our control, some not so much (as of now). We decided to go back to\nthe drawing board and figure out the issues that are in our control and fix them\nfor good. And that is how we built a world-class (arguably üò¨) live-tracking\nexperience.\n\nBut what is live-tracking, you would ask?\n\nLive tracking is a complete map experience. It doesn‚Äôt involve anything other\nthan what you see on maps after you get a driver.\n\nSo, what do you see on maps?\n\n 1. Driver's location depicted by a green marker.\n 2. The routes.\n 3. The change in driver marker as the driver moves closer to your pickup/your\n    destination.\n 4. The change in route as the driver moves.\n\nAnd that‚Äôs it. That‚Äôs all live-tracking is.\n\n> But that sounds quite simple. Right? Use some routing APIs and plot the markers\nand routes.\nWell, yes, it sounded easy to us when we first heard about it too. The real\nexperience threw us a few curveballs. Let‚Äôs go through how we create a\nlive-tracking experience.\n\nInput\nLet‚Äôs look at the input data that we need to create a live-tracking animation:\n\nDriver Location and Routes\nOur driver apps have an in-built mechanism to upload driver location to our\nbackend at regular intervals. This is how we are able to find a driver close to\nyour location when you order one of our services. The primary input to\nlive-tracking is this driver location.\n\nIn our driver app, we get this location using Android‚Äôs FusedLocationProvider \nAPI which automatically uses the best location provider(GPS, Wifi, etc). The\ndriver location is ingested into our backend system via a continuous stream.\nRoutes are generated by our internal routing engine and provided to the customer\napp.\n\nInput Source\nAs you would have guessed, this data is provided via API calls initiated by the\nour Super App to the routing engine.\n\nMaking the API call just once won‚Äôt be sufficient. Right? The app needs to be\ninformed every time the driver‚Äôs location has changed. So, the customer app\npolls this API every few seconds to get this data.\n\nNow, we have a continuous stream of data flowing to our app which has all the\ninformation that we need to show the vehicle animation on the road.\n\nTerminology\nBefore moving forward, we should get acquainted with a few terminologies that we\nwould use quite frequently in this post.\n\n 1. Route: The entire list of latitude-longitudes between the driver location to\n    the pickup/destination location.\n 2. Segment: A segment is the smallest unit of a route. It is a straight line\n    from one position in the routes list to the very next position in the routes\n    list.\n\nA route of length n has n-1 segments. Confused? Yeah, let‚Äôs take an example.\n\nA Route looks like this:\n\n[{-62441198, 106.8032959},\n{-6.2440766, 106.80328}, \n{-6.2439977, 106.8033275},\n{-6.2434893, 106.8029214},\n{-6.2433926, 106.8030539},\n{-6.2436018, 106.803222}]\n\nThere are 5 Segments in this route.\n\nSegment 1: {-6.2441198, 106.8032959,-6.2440766, 106.80328}\nSegment 2: {-6.2440766, 106.80328,-6.2439977, 106.8033275}\nSegment 3: {-6.2439977, 106.8033275,-6.2434893, 106.8029214}\nSegment 4: {-6.2434893, 106.8029214,-6.2433926, 106.8030539}\nSegment 5: {-6.2433926, 106.8030539,-6.2436018, 106.8032224}\n\nThe initial setup\nWhen the user lands on the live tracking screen, the app immediately makes a\ncall to our internal API to get the driver location and route. Once we get this\ndata, we plot it on the map using the standard GoogleMap methods. \ngoogleMap.addMarker(), googleMap.addPolyline() etc.\n\nSometimes, we don‚Äôt have the routing information available immediately, so we\njust show the driver marker. We also store this data locally in an in-memory\ncache as we would need it later to do some comparisons.\n\nSo, the customer is able to see the markers and routes on the map now. So far so\ngood.\n\nThe subsequent updates\nAs I mentioned earlier, we need to change the position of driver marker and\nroute as the driver moves. The customer app makes a call to the same internal\nAPI every few seconds. After the first response, we don‚Äôt move any markers or\nroutes on the map until the next response succeeds.\n\nIn the next response, we again get the same data points i.e the route and driver\nlocation but with different values, of course, if the driver has moved. The next\nset of data that we get can have the following characteristics:\n\n 1. Route and driver location don‚Äôt change\n 2. Route changes\n 3. Route doesn‚Äôt change BUT driver location does\n\nLet‚Äôs discuss these cases one by one.\n\n1: Route and driver location don‚Äôt change\nIf nothing has changed, we don‚Äôt need to do anything. Probably our driver\npartner is stuck in traffic. üòû\n\n2: Route changes\nThis can happen either when:\n\n 1. The app was not showing any route to the user before i.e the first response\n    didn‚Äôt have the route.\n 2. The app was showing a route that is different from the newly received route.\n    This usually happens in cases where the driver starts following a different\n    route from the one they were following before. This can also happen due to\n    road closures or simply because our driver-partner initially followed a\n    wrong route by mistake üòÖ.\n\nIn either of these cases, we simply ignore the old driver marker and routes\nwhich were shown and plot the new marker and routes.\n\n3: Route doesn‚Äôt change BUT driver location does\nThe app was showing the same route to the user before i.e the old response had\nthe same route as the new response. This means that the driver is following the\noriginal route that we determined.\n\nIn this case, we need to animate the driver marker on the map from the old\nlocation to the new location along the same route. This is the most common\nscenario, which can again be broken down further into multiple scenarios (yeah,\nI‚Äôm all about breaking things down ü§ê).\n\n3.1: Does the new location lie on the route?\nTo animate the driver marker from it‚Äôs current position to the new location, we\nfirst need to know whether the new location lies on the route or not.\n\nYeah, we can‚Äôt be sure that the driver location that we have received would\nalways lie on the route/road because of various GPS inaccuracy issues.\n\nWe iterate through every segment in the route to find the segment which has the\nnew location. For every segment, we use the Geometry/PolyUtil library to\ndetermine whether the driver location lies on that route.\n\nWe also specify a tolerance of a few meters to account for GPS inaccuracy. So,\nif the newly received location is within a radius of X meters near a segment,\nthis method will return true.\n\nAndroid\n\nboolean isLocationOnPath(LatLng point,List<LatLng> polyline,boolean geodesic,\ndouble tolerance)\n\niOS\n\nBOOL GMSGeometryIsLocationOnPathToleranc\n[https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios-sdk/reference/group___geometry_utils#ga580ba381b9d4fbc0ff430cf69e06e66d]\ne(CLLocationCoordinate2D point,GMSPath\n[https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios-sdk/reference/interface_g_m_s_path] \n* path,BOOL geodesic,CLLocationDistance tolerance)\n\nIf the location doesn‚Äôt lie on any of the segments in the route, we are sad and\nso, we don‚Äôt animate anything. But if it does, we go forward with the next step\nwhich is‚Ä¶.\n\n3.2: Vehicle projection on route\nWhen we receive a new location, the start location is simply the position that\nthe driver marker is already at. No logic required there to calculate that.\n\nThe end location should simply be the new location that we received. Well, in an\nideal world, it should be but we live so far away from an ideal world üòû.\n\nAs we mentioned earlier, the raw driver location that we get from the driver app\nvia GPS/other providers mostly doesn‚Äôt lie on the road. So, we have to find a\nprojection of the driver location on the road/route.\n\nIf you have been reading carefully, you might wonder why we can‚Äôt just use the \nisLocationOnPath() method above ü§î.\n\nWell, if you had been reading more carefully, you might have noticed that this\nmethod returns a boolean explaining whether the location is on/near the route or\nnot ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇ. It doesn‚Äôt return the projected location. (Ohh..if someone from Maps\nUtils stumbled upon this by chance, please add that method, good sir).\n\nSo, we had to revise some maths. Yeah, folks, learn your maths well. You never\nknow when a situation like this might arise ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ.\n\n‚ÄúFind the projection of point (x,y) on the line y = mx + c‚Äù. Does that ring a\nbell? Drawing a perpendicular line towards the segment and calculating the\nlocation of where the line and route intersect can give us the projected\nlocation. Right?\n\nWell, the above approach works for 2-D systems but earth is not a 2-D space. We\nneed a way to project the spherical surface of the earth onto a rectangle 2-D\nspace. There are several ways to do that. All of them have certain drawbacks. We\nmight lose information like direction or the shape of landmasses/countries or\nthe area information.\n\nMercator Projection\n\nMercator projection is one of the available methods to project the spherical map\nof earth onto a rectangle to make usable maps. Most of the mapping tools used\nfor navigation use this projection.\n\nThe key feature of Mercator projection is that it retains the direction\ninformation. That means if point A is 30deg east from north of point B on the\nglobe, it will be in the same direction on its Mercator projection. Or say there\nis a turn of 90deg in some lane, it will be 90deg on Mercator projection as\nwell. That is the reason it works really well for navigation purposes.\n\nHow to use a Mercator projection?\n\n 1. Every point on the earth is projected on a cylinder exactly like point A\n    which has point A‚Äô on the cylinder.\n 2. Once all the required points/routes are projected on this cylinder. It is\n    unrolled, and we obtain a rectangle like the one shown above.\n 3. All the planar geometry can be applied with a very little margin of error on\n    this 2D projected map.\n 4. After processing all the points/routes they can be converted back to\n    latitude and longitude on the globe.\n\nSo, now we have the projected driver location on the route which we will fondly\ncall snapped point going forward.\n\n3.3: End-to-End animation\nThe new driver location that we receive can be present in any segment. It may be\nthat it is in the same segment or it may be that it is on the next segment or on\nthe next one or it may be that it is on the last segment.\n\nBut for linear animation, we need a start point and an end point. The start\npoint is the current position of the driver marker. We already got the snapped\nendpoint in the earlier section. But we can‚Äôt just animate from start to end at\nonce as that would seem like the car is flying and ignoring U-turns, routes,\netc. So, how do we prevent it from flying?\n\nWhat do you do when you can‚Äôt fly to a place? You follow the road. Right? That‚Äôs\nwhat we have to do as well. Make the driver marker follow the route/road. We\nneed to animate along each segment in the route until we reach the segment which\nhas the driver position that we received.\n\nThere are again two cases here üòú:\n\n3.3.1: The new driver location is on the same segment\nIn this case, we can directly animate from the current position of driver marker\nto the driver location that we received since this is just a straight line\nanimation.\n\nA segment is always a straight line. We will discuss more on how to do the\nanimation b/w 2 points in a later section.\n\n3.3.2: The new driver location is on a different segment\nIn this case, we need to animate to that segment along the route. We have to\nanimate along each of the segments in between to reach the final segment.\n\nFor animation along the first segment, we set the endpoint of the animation to\nthe beginning of the next segment in the route. We animate to the end of the\nfirst segment.\n\nThe next segment may also not have the driver location that we received. After a\ndriver has traversed the first segment, we move the end location of the\nanimation to the end of the next segment, and so on and so forth till we reach\nthe last segment. Confusing, ya? Let‚Äôs see an example.\n\nSo much zig-zag (huh!!)The car icon(A) represents the location in the segment\nwhere the driver marker currently is. The red pin(X) represents the new snapped\nlocation received.\n\nIn the 1st animation, we move the driver marker from A to the end of the first\nsegment (B).\n\nIn the 2nd animation, the driver marker is moved through the entire length of\nthe 2nd segment.\n\nAnd so on and so forth till we reach the segment which has the newly received\nsnapped location (X).\n\nAnimation in a segment\nWe now know how the overall animation would look like. But we also need to\nconfigure how the smallest unit of the animation i.e animation in a segment\nshould happen.\n\nStart point and End point: For case #1 above, the animation in a segment will\nhappen just once. For case #2 above, this animation in a segment will happen\nmultiple times. Start and endpoints will be determined before beginning each of\nthe animations.\n\nBearing b/w these two points: Bearing can be calculated using another one of\nGeometry/Maps Utils method.\n\nSphericalUtil.computeHeading(startPosition, endPosition)\n\nDuration of animation: Calculating duration is a bit tricky. And the duration is\nthe most important thing in any animation. Sometimes the difference b/w a smooth\nand a choppy animation is caused by the duration. It was very important that we\ngot it right. So, let‚Äôs take a break and see how to calculate the duration.\n\nWhat is Duration?\nIt‚Äôs the amount of time for which the animation should happen. But you already\nknow that. Going back to middle school maths (yeah, that far), how do you\ncalculate time? Time is nothing but distance divided by speed. Correct?\nCalculating straight line distance b/w the two points we want to animate through\nis pretty easy.\n\nSphericalUtil.computeDistanceBetween(startLocation, endLocation)\n\nCool, cool. But what about speed? How should we calculate speed?\n\nSpeed calculation\nFusedLocationProvider API in the driver app does provide the speed of the\nvehicle but it‚Äôs highly unreliable. So, we have to employ some tricks to\ncalculate the speed.\n\nSpeed is distance divided by time. Distance again!! Seems like we are running in\ncircles üòµ. Not exactly. Here the distance is not the straight line distance b/w\nthe two points that we have to animate through.\n\nThis is the total distance along the route from the segment that the old driver\nlocation is currently located at, to the segment where the new driver location\nis. Yeah, that statement is a bit confusing. So, let‚Äôs take an example.\n\nThe car icon(A) represents the location in the segment where the driver marker\ncurrently is. The red pin(X) represents the new snapped location received. To\ncalculate the distance, we do the obvious:\n\nTotal distance = d1 + d2 + d3 + d4\n\nNow, we have the distance. We need the time interval.\n\nThe FusedLocationProvider API in the driver app does provide us the timestamp at\nwhich a location was updated. And this information is passed to our backend and\nsubsequently to the customer app.\n\nWe calculate the time difference b/w the old driver location and the new driver\nlocation using their timestamps. Wait, how do we know the old driver location?\nAs we had mentioned earlier, we cache the last available driver location and\nroute in an in-memory cache.\n\nTotal route distance divided by time and now we have the speed for the entire\nduration. Linear distance divided by this speed and now we have the durationfor\na single animation in a segment. Cool, so let‚Äôs get back to the point where we\nbroke off üòÖ.\n\nUpdate the animation\nWith all the above information, we start the animation. But wait? Aren‚Äôt we\nmissing something? We did start an animation b/w two points but how will our\nanimator know how to animate?\n\nAnimation is just a bunch of frame updates that happen every fast. How do we\nupdate the marker position, the starting point of the route, the rotation in\neach and every frame of the animation? Well, the mobile/web framework allows us\nto do something every time the frame is updated.\n\nBut what is this something that we should do?\n\n1. Update marker‚Äôs position\nFor markers, we need to update their position. Once we have the position, we can\nsimply update the marker position using the marker.setPosition(). To find the\nposition during each frame of the animation, we need the percentage of animation\nthat has elapsed.\n\nWe can get the percentage from the Animation framework. Using this percentage\nand the start and end position, we calculate the intermediate position/s like\nthis:\n\nSphericalUtil.interpolate(startPosition, endPosition, fraction)\n\n2. Update Routes\nRoutes need to be aligned with the marker‚Äôs movement. So, we update the routes\nas well using the values above and updating the polyline points of that route\nusing the polyline.setPoints().\n\nAnd that‚Äôs a wrap. The result that we get is a very smooth, measured movement of\nthe vehicle along the road.\n\nThere are a few more tips/tricks that we employ to ensure that there are no\nabrupt changes in the animation.\n\nBut that‚Äôs for next time. üòÉ\n\nWhat‚Äôs next?\nWe still need to go a long way to meet the standards that we have set for\nourselves. Currently, this new experience is only rolled out to GoRide, GoCar,\nand GoBluebird. We are working on bringing the same experience to other services\nlike GoFood, GoSend, and GoShop.

So, the customer app polls this API every few seconds to get this data.</p><p>Now, we have a continuous stream of data flowing to our app which has all the information that we need to show the vehicle animation on the road.</p><h3 id=\"terminology\">Terminology</h3><p>Before moving forward, we should get acquainted with a few terminologies that we would use quite frequently in this post.</p><ol><li><strong><strong>Route</strong></strong>: The entire list of latitude-longitudes between the driver location to the pickup/destination location.</li><li><strong><strong>Segment</strong></strong>: A segment is the smallest unit of a route. It is a straight line from one position in the routes list to the very next position in the routes list.</li></ol><p>A route of length n has n-1 segments. Confused? Yeah, let‚Äôs take an example.</p><p>A <strong><strong>Route</strong></strong> looks like this:</p><p>[{-6<code>2441198, 106.8032959},<br>{-6.2440766, 106.80328}, <br>{-6.2439977, 106.8033275},<br>{-6.2434893, 106.8029214},<br>{-6.2433926, 106.8030539},<br>{-6.2436018, 106.803222}]</code></p><p>There are 5 <strong><strong>Segments</strong></strong> in this route.</p><p><code>Segment 1: {-6.2441198, 106.8032959,-6.2440766, 106.80328}</code><br><code>Segment 2: {-6.2440766, 106.80328,-6.2439977, 106.8033275}</code><br><code>Segment 3: {-6.2439977, 106.8033275,-6.2434893, 106.8029214}</code><br><code>Segment 4: {-6.2434893, 106.8029214,-6.2433926, 106.8030539}</code><br><code>Segment 5: {-6.2433926, 106.8030539,-6.2436018, 106.8032224}</code></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://gojek-ghost.zysk.in/content/images/2020/05/image-1.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><h3 id=\"the-initial-setup\">The initial setup</h3><p>When the user lands on the live tracking screen, the app immediately makes a call to our internal API to get the driver location and route. Once we get this data, we plot it on the map using the standard GoogleMap methods. <code><em><em>googleMap.addMarker()</em></em></code><em><em>, </em></em><code><em><em>googleMap.addPolyline()</em></em></code> etc.</p><p>Sometimes, we don‚Äôt have the routing information available immediately, so we just show the driver marker. We also store this data locally in an in-memory cache as we would need it later to do some comparisons.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/436/1*k9IpgQ4ss-bhKHBY5ETUgg.gif\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>So, the customer is able to see the markers and routes on the map now. So far so good.</p><h3 id=\"the-subsequent-updates\">The subsequent updates</h3><p>As I mentioned earlier, we need to change the position of driver marker and route as the driver moves. The customer app makes a call to the same internal API every few seconds. After the first response, we don‚Äôt move any markers or routes on the map until the next response succeeds.</p><p>In the next response, we again get the same data points i.e the route and driver location but with different values, of course, <strong><strong>if the driver has moved</strong></strong>. The next set of data that we get can have the following characteristics:</p><ol><li>Route and driver location don‚Äôt change</li><li>Route changes</li><li>Route doesn‚Äôt change BUT driver location does</li></ol><p>Let‚Äôs discuss these cases one by one.</p><h3 id=\"1-route-and-driver-location-don-t-change\">1: Route and driver location don‚Äôt change</h3><p>If nothing has changed, we don‚Äôt need to do anything. Probably our driver partner is stuck in traffic. üòû</p><h3 id=\"2-route-changes\">2: Route changes</h3><p>This can happen either when:</p><ol><li>The app was not showing any route to the user before i.e the first response didn‚Äôt have the route.</li><li>The app was showing a route that is different from the newly received route. This usually happens in cases where the driver starts following a different route from the one they were following before. This can also happen due to road closures or simply because our driver-partner initially followed a wrong route by mistake üòÖ.</li></ol><p>In either of these cases, we simply ignore the old driver marker and routes which were shown and plot the new marker and routes.</p><h3 id=\"3-route-doesn-t-change-but-driver-location-does\">3: Route doesn‚Äôt change BUT driver location does</h3><p>The app was showing the same route to the user before i.e the old response had the same route as the new response. This means that the driver is following the original route that we determined.</p><p>In this case, we need to animate the driver marker on the map from the old location to the new location along the same route. This is the most common scenario, which can again be broken down further into multiple scenarios (yeah, I‚Äôm all about breaking things down ü§ê).</p><h3 id=\"3-1-does-the-new-location-lie-on-the-route\">3.1: Does the new location lie on the route?</h3><p>To animate the driver marker from it‚Äôs current position to the new location, we first need to know whether the new location lies on the route or not.</p><p>Yeah, we can‚Äôt be sure that the driver location that we have received would always lie on the route/road because of various GPS inaccuracy issues.</p><p>We iterate through every segment in the route to find the segment which has the new location. For every segment, we use the Geometry/PolyUtil library to determine whether the driver location lies on that route.</p><p>We also specify a tolerance of a few meters to account for GPS inaccuracy. So, if the newly received location is within a radius of <strong><strong>X meters</strong></strong> near a segment, this method will return true.</p><p><strong><strong>Android</strong></strong></p><p><code>boolean isLocationOnPath(LatLng point,List&lt;LatLng&gt; polyline,boolean geodesic, double tolerance)</code></p><p><strong><strong>iOS</strong></strong></p><p><code>BOOL <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios-sdk/reference/group___geometry_utils#ga580ba381b9d4fbc0ff430cf69e06e66d\" rel=\"noopener\">GMSGeometryIsLocationOnPathToleranc</a>e(CLLocationCoordinate2D point,<a href=\"https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios-sdk/reference/interface_g_m_s_path\" rel=\"noopener\">GMSPath</a> * path,BOOL geodesic,CLLocationDistance tolerance)</code></p><p>If the location doesn‚Äôt lie on any of the segments in the route, we are sad and so, we don‚Äôt animate anything. But if it does, we go forward with the next step which is‚Ä¶.</p><h3 id=\"3-2-vehicle-projection-on-route\">3.2: Vehicle projection on route</h3><p>When we receive a new location, the start location is simply the position that the driver marker is already at. No logic required there to calculate that.</p><p>The end location should simply be the new location that we received. Well, in an ideal world, it <strong><strong>should be</strong></strong> but we live so far away from an ideal world üòû.</p><p>As we mentioned earlier, the raw driver location that we get from the driver app via GPS/other providers mostly doesn‚Äôt lie on the road. So, we have to find a projection of the driver location on the road/route.</p><p>If you have been reading carefully, you might wonder why we can‚Äôt just use the <em><em>isLocationOnPath()</em></em> method above ü§î.</p><p>Well, if you had been reading <em><em>more</em></em> carefully, you might have noticed that this method returns a boolean explaining whether the location is on/near the route or not ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇ. It doesn‚Äôt return the projected location. (Ohh..if someone from Maps Utils stumbled upon this by chance, please add that method, good sir).</p><p>So, we had to revise some maths. Yeah, folks, learn your maths well. You never know when a situation like this might arise ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ.</p><p><em><em>‚ÄúFind the projection of point (x,y) on the line y = mx + c‚Äù.</em></em> Does that ring a bell? Drawing a perpendicular line towards the segment and calculating the location of where the line and route intersect can give us the projected location. Right?</p><p>Well, the above approach works for 2-D systems but earth is not a 2-D space. We need a way to project the spherical surface of the earth onto a rectangle 2-D space. There are several ways to do that. All of them have certain drawbacks. We might lose information like direction or the shape of landmasses/countries or the area information.</p><p><strong><strong>Mercator Projection</strong></strong></p><p>Mercator projection is one of the available methods to project the spherical map of earth onto a rectangle to make usable maps. Most of the mapping tools used for navigation use this projection.</p><p>The key feature of Mercator projection is that it retains the direction information. That means if point A is 30deg east from north of point B on the globe, it will be in the same direction on its Mercator projection. Or say there is a turn of 90deg in some lane, it will be 90deg on Mercator projection as well. That is the reason it works really well for navigation purposes.</p><p><strong><strong>How to use a Mercator projection?</strong></strong></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://gojek-ghost.zysk.in/content/images/2020/05/image-4.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://gojek-ghost.zysk.in/content/images/2020/05/image-5.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><ol><li>Every point on the earth is projected on a cylinder exactly like point A which has point A‚Äô on the cylinder.</li><li>Once all the required points/routes are projected on this cylinder. It is unrolled, and we obtain a rectangle like the one shown above.</li><li>All the planar geometry can be applied with a very little margin of error on this 2D projected map.</li><li>After processing all the points/routes they can be converted back to latitude and longitude on the globe.</li></ol><p>So, now we have the projected driver location on the route which we will fondly call <code>snapped point</code> going forward.</p><h3 id=\"3-3-end-to-end-animation\">3.3: End-to-End animation</h3><p>The new driver location that we receive can be present in <strong><strong>any</strong></strong> segment. It may be that it is in the same segment or it may be that it is on the next segment or on the next one or it may be that it is on the last segment.</p><p>But for linear animation, we need a start point and an end point. The start point is the current position of the driver marker. We already got the snapped endpoint in the earlier section. But we can‚Äôt just animate from start to end <strong><strong>at once</strong></strong> as that would seem like the car is flying and ignoring U-turns, routes, etc. So, how do we prevent it from flying?</p><p>What do you do when you can‚Äôt fly to a place? You follow the road. Right? That‚Äôs what we have to do as well. Make the driver marker follow the route/road. We need to animate along each segment in the route until we reach the segment which has the driver position that we received.</p><p>There are again two cases here üòú:</p><h3 id=\"3-3-1-the-new-driver-location-is-on-the-same-segment\">3.3.1: The new driver location is on the same segment</h3><p>In this case, we can directly animate from the current position of driver marker to the driver location that we received since this is just a straight line animation.</p><p>A segment is always a straight line. We will discuss more on how to do the animation b/w 2 points in a later section.</p><h3 id=\"3-3-2-the-new-driver-location-is-on-a-different-segment\">3.3.2: The new driver location is on a different segment</h3><p>In this case, we need to animate to that segment along the route. We have to animate along each of the segments in between to reach the final segment.</p><p>For animation along the first segment, we set the endpoint of the animation to the beginning of the next segment in the route. We animate to the end of the first segment.</p><p>The next segment may also not have the driver location that we received. After a driver has traversed the first segment, we move the end location of the animation to the end of the next segment, and so on and so forth till we reach the last segment. Confusing, ya? Let‚Äôs see an example.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://gojek-ghost.zysk.in/content/images/2020/05/Screenshot-2020-05-23-at-10.06.55-PM.png\" class=\"kg-image\"><figcaption>So much zig-zag (huh!!)</figcaption></figure><p>The car icon(A) represents the location in the segment where the driver marker currently is. The red pin(X) represents the new snapped location received.</p><p>In the 1st animation, we move the driver marker from A to the end of the first segment (B).</p><p>In the 2nd animation, the driver marker is moved through the entire length of the 2nd segment.</p><p>And so on and so forth till we reach the segment which has the newly received snapped location (X).</p><h2 id=\"animation-in-a-segment\">Animation in a segment</h2><p>We now know how the overall animation would look like. But we also need to configure how the smallest unit of the animation i.e animation in a segment should happen.</p><p><strong><strong>Start point and End point</strong></strong>: For case #1 above, the animation in a segment will happen just once. For case #2 above, this animation in a segment will happen multiple times. Start and endpoints will be determined before beginning each of the animations.</p><p><strong><strong>Bearing b/w these two points</strong></strong>: Bearing can be calculated using another one of Geometry/Maps Utils method.</p><p><code>SphericalUtil.computeHeading(startPosition, endPosition)</code></p><p><strong><strong>Duration of animation: </strong></strong>Calculating duration is a bit tricky. And the duration is the most important thing in any animation. Sometimes the difference b/w a smooth and a choppy animation is caused by the duration. It was very important that we got it right. So, let‚Äôs take a break and see how to calculate the duration.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-duration\">What is Duration?</h2><p>It‚Äôs the amount of time for which the animation should happen. But you already know that. Going back to middle school maths (yeah, that far), how do you calculate time? Time is nothing but distance divided by speed. Correct? Calculating straight line distance b/w the two points we want to animate through is pretty easy.</p><p><code>SphericalUtil.computeDistanceBetween(startLocation, endLocation)</code></p><p>Cool, cool. But what about speed? How should we calculate speed?</p><h2 id=\"speed-calculation\">Speed calculation</h2><p><code>FusedLocationProvider</code> API in the driver app does provide the speed of the vehicle but it‚Äôs highly unreliable. So, we have to employ some tricks to calculate the speed.</p><p>Speed is distance divided by time. Distance again!! Seems like we are running in circles üòµ. Not exactly. Here the distance is not the straight line distance b/w the two points that we have to animate through.</p><p>This is the total distance along the route <strong><strong>from</strong></strong> the segment that the old driver location is currently located at, <strong><strong>to</strong></strong> the segment where the new driver location is. Yeah, that statement is a bit confusing. So, let‚Äôs take an example.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://gojek-ghost.zysk.in/content/images/2020/05/image-8.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>The car icon(A) represents the location in the segment where the driver marker currently is. The red pin(X) represents the new snapped location received. To calculate the distance, we do the obvious:</p><p><code>Total distance = d1 + d2 + d3 + d4</code></p><p>Now, we have the distance. We need the time interval.</p><p>The <code>FusedLocationProvider</code> API in the driver app does provide us the timestamp at which a location was updated. And this information is passed to our backend and subsequently to the customer app.</p><p>We calculate the time difference b/w the old driver location and the new driver location using their timestamps. Wait, how do we know the old driver location? As we had mentioned earlier, we cache the last available driver location and route in an in-memory cache.</p><p>Total route distance divided by time and now we have the speed for the entire duration. Linear distance divided by this speed and now we have the <strong><strong>duration</strong></strong>for a single animation in a segment. Cool, so let‚Äôs get back to the point where we broke off üòÖ.</p><h1 id=\"update-the-animation\">Update the animation</h1><p>With all the above information, we start the animation. But wait? Aren‚Äôt we missing something? We did start an animation b/w two points but how will our animator know <strong><strong>how</strong></strong> to animate?</p><p>Animation is just a bunch of frame updates that happen every fast. How do we update the marker position, the starting point of the route, the rotation in each and every frame of the animation? Well, the mobile/web framework allows us to do something every time the frame is updated.</p><p>But what is this something that we should do?</p><h2 id=\"1-update-marker-s-position\">1. Update marker‚Äôs position</h2><p>For markers, we need to update their position. Once we have the position, we can simply update the marker position using the <code>marker.setPosition()</code>. To find the position during each frame of the animation, we need the percentage of animation that has elapsed.</p><p>We can get the percentage from the Animation framework. Using this percentage and the start and end position, we calculate the intermediate position/s like this:</p><p><code>SphericalUtil.interpolate(startPosition, endPosition, fraction)</code></p><h2 id=\"2-update-routes\">2. Update Routes</h2><p>Routes need to be aligned with the marker‚Äôs movement. So, we update the routes as well using the values above and updating the polyline points of that route using the <code>polyline.setPoints()</code><em><em>.</em></em></p><p>And that‚Äôs a wrap. The result that we get is a very smooth, measured movement of the vehicle along the road.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/600/1*EtoKV1x7ufBgxOPdcsvnJg.gif\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>There are a few more tips/tricks that we employ to ensure that there are no abrupt changes in the animation.</p><p>But that‚Äôs for next time. üòÉ</p><h3 id=\"what-s-next\">What‚Äôs next?</h3><p>We still need to go a long way to meet the standards that we have set for ourselves. Currently, this new experience is only rolled out to GoRide, GoCar, and GoBluebird. We are working on bringing the same experience to other services like GoFood, GoSend, and GoShop.

But the journey doesn‚Äôt stop there. Even after\nbuilding all these convenient products, we still try and reduce frictions that\nmay be encountered even within our app ‚Äî such as booking a ride or ordering\nfood.\n\nSo we thought, why don‚Äôt we integrate with Google Assistant, and let our users\ncommunicate with our products in a new way?\n\nIn this post, we explain how we integrated our food and transport products with\nthe Google Assistant.\n\nThe why\nWe‚Äôve already addressed one part of the why ‚Äî convenience. The other is user\nre-engagement. According to this survey\n[https://andrewchen.co/new-data-shows-why-losing-80-of-your-mobile-users-is-normal-and-that-the-best-apps-do-much-better/?utm_content=buffere4fa2&utm_medium=twitter.com&utm_source=social&utm_campaign=buffer] \nconducted by Silicon Valley researcher Andrew Chen 77% of users stop using an\napp three days after they install it. Within a month, that number goes up to\n90%. ?\n\nThe how\nTo help integrate Android apps with the Google Assistant, Google launched App\nActions:\n\nWhat are app actions?\nApp Actions are a new way to make your android app content available in places\nlike Google Search, Google Assistant etc. From a user‚Äôs perspective, App Actions\nbehave like shortcuts to parts of your Android app. When users invoke an App\nAction, the Assistant either launches a screen in the Android app that the user\nhas already installed or shows an embedded visual card (Android Slice) that\nusers can interact with.\n\nApp actions provide a faster way for users to access Android apps. It can be\nachieved in two ways:- either user can be directed to a specific\nactivity(screen) using a deep link or user may see relevant content on the\nAssistant itself called Slices.\n\nMore info on this can be found here: \nhttps://developers.google.com/assistant/app/overview\n\nWhat are Slices?\nSlices are super-powered app actions. They provide a way to interact with apps\nwithout moving away from Assistant by showing a small piece of UI within\nAssistant. Slices are UI templates that can display rich, dynamic, and\ninteractive content from the app in Google Assistant.\n\nSlices can help users perform tasks faster by enabling engagement outside of the\nfullscreen app experience.\n\nYou can build Slices as enhancements to App Actions.\n\nHere‚Äôs an example:\n\nWe choose to use slices to show food order status, as the order status will have\nlimited information (eg. Driver is on the way to Restaurant, with his location\non Map ) which can be easily shown in a small piece of UI segment.\n\nIn fact, this functionality was recently demoed on stage at a Google event in\nIndonesia. You can check it out below:\n\nApp Actions Demo at #Google4ID 2019How does it work?\nWhenever a user says or types something in Assistant, assistant parses the\nquery. If the query matches the built-in intent\n[https://developers.google.com/assistant/app/reference/built-in-intents] grammar\nthen Google Assistant extracts the query parameter in schema.org\n[https://schema.org/] and generates a deep link URL using the mapping we provide\nin an actions.xml file.\n\nGoogle then attaches those extracted parameters to the deep link URL and creates\na final deep link which allows a user to launch specific content or screens in\nthe app.\n\nLet‚Äôs dig a little deeper:\n\nGoogle applies Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (Natural Language\nProcessing) to understand all the sentences we type in Assistant.\n\nWhile users can type anything they want in Assistant and the system gets better\nat interpreting them over time, but there are some sentences for specific intent\nthat are fixed by Google. More info here\n[https://developers.google.com/assistant/app/reference/built-in-intents#create-taxi-reservation]\n.\n\nHow did we integrate our services with Assistant?\nThe core of integrating Gojek with Assistant involved creating actions on Google\nAssistant with actions.xml file.\n\nLet‚Äôs explore how to do this:\n\n1. Create actions.xml file in your XML folder. This contains all the actions\nwith built-in intents which define what actions our app can support in the\nAssistant. Each action contains built-in intents\n[https://developers.google.com/assistant/app/reference/built-in-intents#create-taxi-reservation] \nsupported by Google as a <intent-name> tag.\n\n2. Define a fulfilment mode for each app action ‚Äî which can be deep links or\nslices. You have to pass a fulfilment mode in each action. This is compulsory.\n\n3. Pass the URL template which will allow a user to launch your app ‚Äî this can\nbe the deep link to your app or URL to Slice provider.\n\n4. Define entity-set ‚Äî the Gojek app is available in multiple locales, so to\nprovide locale for all the regions, we added the entity-set, which allows\nAssistant to understand more than one version of category. ex:- taxi can be\npronounced as taksi in Bahasa.\n\nSo, If you want locale for your specific parameter in deep-link URL, you can\nsimply attach an entity-set with that parameter, see how you can achieve this in\nbelow example\n\n<parameter name=‚ÄùtaxiReservation.category‚Äù><entity-set-reference\nentitySetId=‚ÄùTransportCategoryEntitySet‚Äù /></parameter>\n\n5. Add a reference to actions.xml file using the <meta> tag in your app‚Äôs\nmanifest.xml file inside the application tag.\n\nIn order to integrate Slices:\n\n 1. Implement an Android Slice by following the steps described in the Slices\n    Getting Started guide\n    [https://developer.android.com/guide/slices/getting-started].\n 2.

Here‚Äôs what we learned in the process.</h3><p><strong><strong><em>By Vikas Bajpayee and Lokesh Kalal</em></strong></strong></p><p>Our aim behind building a Super App was to help our users get rid of the daily frictions in their lives. But the journey doesn‚Äôt stop there. Even after building all these convenient products, we still try and reduce frictions that may be encountered even within our app ‚Äî such as booking a ride or ordering food.</p><p>So we thought, why don‚Äôt we integrate with Google Assistant, and let our users communicate with our products in a new way?</p><p>In this post, we explain how we integrated our food and transport products with the Google Assistant.</p><h1 id=\"the-why\">The why</h1><p>We‚Äôve already addressed one part of the <em><em>why ‚Äî </em></em>convenience. The other is user re-engagement. According to <a href=\"https://andrewchen.co/new-data-shows-why-losing-80-of-your-mobile-users-is-normal-and-that-the-best-apps-do-much-better/?utm_content=buffere4fa2&amp;utm_medium=twitter.com&amp;utm_source=social&amp;utm_campaign=buffer\" rel=\"noopener\">this survey</a> conducted by Silicon Valley researcher Andrew Chen 77% of users stop using an app three days after they install it.

They provide a way to interact with apps without moving away from Assistant by showing a small piece of UI within Assistant. Slices are UI templates that can display rich, dynamic, and interactive content from the app in Google Assistant.</p><p><em><em>Slices can help users perform tasks faster by enabling engagement outside of the fullscreen app experience.</em></em></p><p>You can build Slices as enhancements to App Actions.</p><p>Here‚Äôs an example:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1080/1*EFF30b3185UtwKYjx0VP1A.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>We choose to use slices to show food order status, as the order status will have limited information (eg. Driver is on the way to Restaurant, with his location on Map ) which can be easily shown in a small piece of UI segment.</p><p>In fact, this functionality was recently demoed on stage at a Google event in Indonesia.

Create <strong><strong>actions.xml</strong></strong> file in your XML folder. This contains all the actions with built-in intents which define what actions our app can support in the Assistant. Each action contains<a href=\"https://developers.google.com/assistant/app/reference/built-in-intents#create-taxi-reservation\" rel=\"noopener\"> built-in intents</a> supported by Google as a &lt;intent-name&gt; tag.</p><p>2. Define a fulfilment mode for each app action ‚Äî which can be deep links or slices. You have to pass a fulfilment mode in each action. This is compulsory.</p><p>3. Pass the URL template which will allow a user to launch your app ‚Äî this can be the deep link to your app or URL to Slice provider.</p><p>4. Define entity-set ‚Äî the Gojek app is available in multiple locales, so to provide locale for all the regions, we added the entity-set, which allows Assistant to understand more than one version of category. ex:- taxi can be pronounced as taksi in Bahasa.</p><p>So, If you want locale for your specific parameter in deep-link URL, you can simply attach an entity-set with that parameter, see how you can achieve this in below example</p><p><em>&lt;parameter name=‚ÄùtaxiReservation.category‚Äù&gt;&lt;entity-set-reference entitySetId=‚ÄùTransportCategoryEntitySet‚Äù /&gt;&lt;/parameter&gt;</em></p><p>5.

Our pickup points are\ndesigned to make lives easier for both customers and driver partners.\n\nThis is possible because the pickup points shown on the app are popular pickup\nlocations around the area. What‚Äôs more, the pickup point names are displayed\nexactly how customers driver partners usually refer to them.\n\nBut how do we manage to name so many pickup points accurately, and at scale?\n\nWe use past booking locations and their associated chat logs to discover named\npickup points. As our previous research has explained, we first perform \nclustering\n[https://blog.gojekengineering.com/fantastic-drivers-and-how-to-find-them-a88239ef3b29] \non historical bookings to form potential pickup points, then we use a language\nmodel\n[https://blog.gojekengineering.com/how-i-met-my-gojek-driver-without-a-single-call-95041f4fdd03] \nto select the best name. Here, we explain how we improved upon the previous\nstatistical language model with a state-of-the-art NLP model, which makes the\nentire naming exercise fully scalable. This is the magic behind all the pickup\npoints seen on the Gojek app.\n\nHow can we learn better?\nAs explained in our previous post, our original statistical language model\nselects the best pickup point name from the most probable n-grams extracted from\nbookings text. However, such a statistical language model doesn‚Äôt ‚Äòunderstand‚Äô\nthe meaning of the texts, it simply chooses phrases with high frequencies\nwithout knowing the semantics. Sometimes it throws street names, sometimes even\ncommon phrases with no information about location. We have to manually check\neverything to make sure it reflects the right POI, before it appears on the app.\n\nThis creates a challenge ‚Äî especially if we want to quickly expand the\nfrictionless pickup experience to customers across in new geographies. Hence, we\ndecided to go a step further with a deep-learning NLP model that ‚Äòunderstands‚Äô\nand ‚Äòlearns‚Äô to differentiate what is a valid pickup point name.\n\nAt Gojek, we never stop thinking and always go a step further\n\nMeet CartoBERT ?\nOne of the most recent and impactful breakthroughs NLP was the publication of\nBERT[1] ‚Äî a contextual language representation with transformer models ‚Äî by\nGoogle in late 2018. It obtained state-of-the-art results on a wide array of NLP\ntasks. In the 2019, many NLP researches were influenced by BERT, including\nXLNet, RoBERTa, ERNIE etc.\n\nBERT Explained\nBERT, or Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, is composed of\nan embedding layer, followed by groups of transformer layers.\n\nEvery word (token) in the input sentence will first get encoded into its\nembedding representations in the embedding layer, and then go through\nbidirectional transformer encoder layers. Every encoder layer will perform the\nmulti-head attention computation on the token representation from the previous\nlayer to create a new intermediate representation, which is then output to the\nnext layer. The output from the final layer is the contextual representation of\nthe input token. A pooled sentence level representation combining all token\nrepresentations could be created if needed by specific downstream tasks.\n\nWith the final contextual representations at either token or sentence level, a\npre-trained BERT on large unlabelled text corpus, could be further extended to a\nwide variety of NLP tasks, such as text classification, question answering,\nNamed Entity Recognition (NER) etc.\n\nALBERT[2], published by Google in Sep 2019, improved on BERT with embedding\nparameter factorisation and cross layer parameter sharing to reduce the number\nof parameters (by 9 times for base model). It also uses sequence order\nprediction instead of next sentence prediction for the pre-train task. In the\npaper, ALBERT also outperforms BERT on standard NLP tasks/datasets (SQUAD, RACE\netc), with fewer parameters.\n\nPre-train CartoBERT to learn language representation from Gojek bookings text\nInspired by ALBERT‚Äôs lightweight model and performance, we developed CartoBERT,\nGojek‚Äôs very own pickup point name recognition model, based on ALBERT‚Äôs\narchitecture.\n\nAs illustrated below, the uncased CartoBERT is pre-trained on Gojek‚Äôs own masked\nbookings text corpus of about 200 million sentences. Booking text is first\npre-processed for data masking to mask all customer sensitive information,\nlanguage detection, text normalisation (including text cleaning, slang,\nabbreviation transformations, lowercase transformation and emoji removal). The\npre-processed text is used to build subword vocabularies which handles\nOut-Of-Vocabulary (OOV) tokens that could be decomposed to frequent subword\npatterns. CartoBERT tokenizer is then created with the subword vocabularies and\nfurther used to encode and tokenize the same preprocessed bookings text to form\npre-trained input files.\n\nSame as ALBERT, the model is pre-trained to ‚Äòunderstand‚Äô Gojek‚Äôs bookings text\nusing Masked Language Model ‚Äî which predicts randomly masked tokens in input\nsentences ‚Äî and Sentence Order Prediction tasks, which predicts the order of\ninput sentences pair.\n\nFine-tuning CartoBERT to extract pickup point names from Gojek bookings text\nWith the huge amount of bookings text we have at Gojek, now CartoBERT can better\n‚Äòunderstand‚Äô past bookings text. Theoretically, it ‚Äòunderstands‚Äô every word of a\nbooking text sentence.\n\nFor every token in the input sentence, CartoBERT will output a 768-dimension\nvector (we use the default hidden layer size of the ALBERT base model in\nCartoBERT, however this is configurable) from last transformer encoder layer,\nand we use that to represent CartoBERT‚Äôs ‚Äòunderstanding‚Äô of the token‚Äôs meaning\nin the sentence context for fine-tune step.\n\nAs illustrated in the diagram below, while fine-tuning CartoBERT for pickup\npoint name recognition, we replace the Masked Language Model and Sequence Order\nPrediction layers from CartoBERT in pre-train step with token classification\nlayer. The token classification layer learns to predict the probability of a\ntoken belonging to a pickup point name, with the final token representation\noutput from CartoBERT transformer layers, from labelled training data created\nwith bookings text sentences, and corresponding pickup point names. Here, we use\nweighted cross entropy loss to deal with class imbalance, as tokens tagged to\npickup point names are a minority.\n\n\n\nWith this, CartoBERT is fine-tuned to extract pickup point names from bookings\ntext sentences, if any.\n\nHow does the model perform?\nCartoBERT gives a lift of more than 25% in pickup point name accuracy to ~93%\naccuracy, which is measured as the percentage of valid pick up point names out\nof generated names. With this high accuracy, we have achieved full scalability\nof automatic generation for named pickup points to quickly cover multiple\ngeographies without heavy reliance on human inputs.\n\nWhat‚Äôs next?\nWe are not stopping here and are exploring using active learning to further\nimprove CartoBERT. With active learning, we only flag out uncertain predictions,\nwhich are measured as sentence level least token probability[3] for human\nlabelling. We then use human-curated data as feedback for model learning. In\nthis way, we can improve model learning efficiency with minimum labelling\neffort.\n\nWhat‚Äôs more, with the success of CartoBERT, we are considering pre-training and\nopen sourcing a general Indonesia Bahasa ALBERT model with Indonesia open corpus\nfrom wiki, news, Twitter etc. Currently, the options for open-sourced language\nmodel in Indonesia Bahasa are very limited, only pre-trained static word\nembeddings such as word2vec, fasttext etc are available. It would be beneficial\nto the community if we have a good state-of-the-art attention-based transformer\nmodel for the language. Stay tuned for more updates from the Cartography Data\nScience team. ?\n\nLeave a ? if you liked what you read.

Hence, we decided to go a step further with a deep-learning NLP model that ‚Äòunderstands‚Äô and ‚Äòlearns‚Äô to differentiate what is a valid pickup point name.</p><p><em><em>At Gojek, we never stop thinking and always go a step further</em></em></p><h1 id=\"meet-cartobert-\">Meet CartoBERT ?</h1><p>One of the most recent and impactful breakthroughs NLP was the publication of BERT[1] ‚Äî a contextual language representation with transformer models ‚Äî by Google in late 2018. It obtained state-of-the-art results on a wide array of NLP tasks. In the 2019, many NLP researches were influenced by BERT, including XLNet, RoBERTa, ERNIE etc.</p><h2 id=\"bert-explained\">BERT Explained</h2><p>BERT, or Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, is composed of an embedding layer, followed by groups of transformer layers.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1226/1*qHFXdPcW_3UkLEsRJy2FRg.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>Every word (token) in the input sentence will first get encoded into its embedding representations in the embedding layer, and then go through bidirectional transformer encoder layers. Every encoder layer will perform the multi-head attention computation on the token representation from the previous layer to create a new intermediate representation, which is then output to the next layer. The output from the final layer is the contextual representation of the input token. A pooled sentence level representation combining all token representations could be created if needed by specific downstream tasks.</p><p>With the final contextual representations at either token or sentence level, a pre-trained BERT on large unlabelled text corpus, could be further extended to a wide variety of NLP tasks, such as text classification, question answering, Named Entity Recognition (NER) etc.</p><p>ALBERT[2], published by Google in Sep 2019, improved on BERT with embedding parameter factorisation and cross layer parameter sharing to reduce the number of parameters (by 9 times for base model). It also uses sequence order prediction instead of next sentence prediction for the pre-train task. In the paper, ALBERT also outperforms BERT on standard NLP tasks/datasets (SQUAD, RACE etc), with fewer parameters.</p><h2 id=\"pre-train-cartobert-to-learn-language-representation-from-gojek-bookings-text\">Pre-train CartoBERT to learn language representation from Gojek bookings text</h2><p>Inspired by ALBERT‚Äôs lightweight model and performance, we developed CartoBERT, Gojek‚Äôs very own pickup point name recognition model, based on ALBERT‚Äôs architecture.</p><p>As illustrated below, the uncased CartoBERT is pre-trained on Gojek‚Äôs own masked bookings text corpus of about 200 million sentences. Booking text is first pre-processed for data masking to mask all customer sensitive information, language detection, text normalisation (including text cleaning, slang, abbreviation transformations, lowercase transformation and emoji removal). The pre-processed text is used to build subword vocabularies which handles Out-Of-Vocabulary (OOV) tokens that could be decomposed to frequent subword patterns. CartoBERT tokenizer is then created with the subword vocabularies and further used to encode and tokenize the same preprocessed bookings text to form pre-trained input files.</p><p>Same as ALBERT, the model is pre-trained to ‚Äòunderstand‚Äô Gojek‚Äôs bookings text using Masked Language Model ‚Äî which predicts randomly masked tokens in input sentences ‚Äî and Sentence Order Prediction tasks, which predicts the order of input sentences pair.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1386/1*STaqWssxlYPhFaDulLwJzg.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><h2 id=\"fine-tuning-cartobert-to-extract-pickup-point-names-from-gojek-bookings-text\">Fine-tuning CartoBERT to extract pickup point names from Gojek bookings text</h2><p>With the huge amount of bookings text we have at Gojek, now CartoBERT can better ‚Äòunderstand‚Äô past bookings text. Theoretically, it ‚Äòunderstands‚Äô every word of a booking text sentence.</p><p>For every token in the input sentence, CartoBERT will output a 768-dimension vector (we use the default hidden layer size of the ALBERT base model in CartoBERT, however this is configurable) from last transformer encoder layer, and we use that to represent CartoBERT‚Äôs ‚Äòunderstanding‚Äô of the token‚Äôs meaning in the sentence context for fine-tune step.</p><p>As illustrated in the diagram below, while fine-tuning CartoBERT for pickup point name recognition, we replace the Masked Language Model and Sequence Order Prediction layers from CartoBERT in pre-train step with token classification layer. The token classification layer learns to predict the probability of a token belonging to a pickup point name, with the final token representation output from CartoBERT transformer layers, from labelled training data created with bookings text sentences, and corresponding pickup point names. Here, we use weighted cross entropy loss to deal with class imbalance, as tokens tagged to pickup point names are a minority.</p><p></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1526/1*WO1LRHQPqAqzpLBMMl-NuA.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>With this, CartoBERT is fine-tuned to extract pickup point names from bookings text sentences, if any.</p><h2 id=\"how-does-the-model-perform\">How does the model perform?</h2><p>CartoBERT gives a lift of more than 25% in pickup point name accuracy to ~93% accuracy, which is measured as the percentage of valid pick up point names out of generated names. With this high accuracy, we have achieved full scalability of automatic generation for named pickup points to quickly cover multiple geographies without heavy reliance on human inputs.</p><h1 id=\"what-s-next\">What‚Äôs next?</h1><p>We are not stopping here and are exploring using active learning to further improve CartoBERT. With active learning, we only flag out uncertain predictions, which are measured as sentence level least token probability[3] for human labelling. We then use human-curated data as feedback for model learning. In this way, we can improve model learning efficiency with minimum labelling effort.</p><p>What‚Äôs more, with the success of CartoBERT, we are considering pre-training and open sourcing a general Indonesia Bahasa ALBERT model with Indonesia open corpus from wiki, news, Twitter etc. Currently, the options for open-sourced language model in Indonesia Bahasa are very limited, only pre-trained static word embeddings such as word2vec, fasttext etc are available. It would be beneficial to the community if we have a good state-of-the-art attention-based transformer model for the language. Stay tuned for more updates from the Cartography Data Science team. ?</p><p>Leave a ? if you liked what you read.

It‚Äôs a holy tree whose branches touch the heavens.\nThe gods hold court beneath Yggdrasil ‚Äî debating the fates of other gods, men\nand monsters. It‚Äôs the tree of life and the centre of everything in Norse\nmythology. In GOJEK, think of the `Allocations` team as this eternal green ash\ntree. Our multiple products rely on this team to assign drivers to complete\norders.\n\nThe team cuts across products and services responsible for 1,000,000+ registered\ndrivers on our platform.\n\nAnd 12 engineers do this.\n\nA similar ride-sharing equivalent has 300-odd people solving the same problem\nand still does fewer bookings. But how do they do it? This is their story.\n\nOn planet Earth, problems galore\nWhen GOJEK started in 2010, it all began with a call centre. Customers would\ncall a number, the call centre would ‚Äòallocate‚Äô a driver after looking at an\nExcel sheet of drivers in the roster. Our CEO Nadiem Makarim was the first\nperson to test the app built for drivers and customers. As soon as a dummy order\nwas created and Nadiem got the first notification, GOJEK was open for business.\n\nAt its peak in 2014, GOJEK had 200 drivers. The 3-person engineering team had a\nbasic stop-gap model of matchmaking between a driver and a customer. This\ncodebase had to be reworked to match scale. The new matchmaking codebase was\nbuilt in two days and could handle about 700 drivers. It was all manual and\nsomething had to be done to automate\n[https://blog.gojekengineering.com/how-we-do-what-we-do-at-go-jek-tech-d1d5d952e13] \nthe whole process.\n\nIn the beginning of 2015, a version of the app was launched to keep pace with\nincreasing demand. GO-RIDE, GO-FOOD and GO-SEND went live. Customers would ‚Äòbid‚Äô\nfor a driver, drivers would get a notification, accept a drive and voila, we‚Äôre\ngood to go. This was the birth of the ‚Äòbid engine‚Äô ‚Äî a classic matchmaker\nbetween supply and demand: Driver and Customer. It would form the genesis on\nwhich GOJEK was going to be built. The problem: siloed boxes.\n\nThere were a total of three products with the same underlying infrastructure,\nbut no interconnectedness. THAT was a problem that shouldn‚Äôt exist when success\ndepends on deeper linkage between all teams. This problem is further pronounced\nwhen you realise all three teams were working on the same infrastructure.\n\nImportantly, GOJEK simply wasn‚Äôt prepared to handle the kind of adoption and\ngrowth the company began to witness as soon as the app was launched.\n\nThe algorithm started to crumble. The engineering was pretty straightforward\nwith 10‚Äì15 lines of code, and solved problems for a small set of data. As the\ndrivers increased, downtimes became a routine affair. There were way too many\nbottlenecks. GOJEK was failing, and fast.\n\nSoon, Sequoia had mutual investment portfolios and unlocked some doors. Sidu\nPonnappa, our current India Head, then the CEO of CodeMonk, travelled to\nIndonesia to pick between three of Sequoia‚Äôs companies. The team‚Äôs ultimate\ndecision to work with GOJEK is not entirely surprising because it was bigger,\nlarger than anything they had witnessed in India. The market was ripe for the\ntaking. Read his telling tale from his first visit to Indonesia here.\n[https://blog.gojekengineering.com/my-go-jek-story-af5f1925bfe]\n\nIn no time, Nadiem acquired CodeMonk. But before that, our current CTO, Niranjan\nParanjappe was being poached. ? The team stood together. It was all, or none.\n\nAnd Nadiem wanted all. The deal was closed in a small tea shop between Sidu,\nNiranjan, Nadiem, Ajey and Kevin. Overnight, GOJEK had one of India‚Äôs best\nconsulting firms in its arsenal. The task for the engineering team: Work on the\nbidding engine. No more downtimes.\n\nIt‚Äôs the 0‚Äôs and 1‚Äôs\nThe old codebase was written in Java. It‚Äôs a programming language that belonged\nto the Internet age. But not for a startup in 2015 that was exploding in demand\nand imploding with a lack of resources and engineering wherewithal. Why Java?\nBecause, the classic Golden Hammer Anti-Pattern:\n\n‚ÄúIf all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.‚Äù And hence, ‚ÄòI know\nJava, so Java is the best.‚Äô\n\nNiranjan Paranjape\n[https://medium.com/u/689ebe477c46?source=post_page-----978af9ccfd32----------------------]\n, our now CTO (Ajey Gore\n[https://medium.com/u/bb9ef62c7bae?source=post_page-----978af9ccfd32----------------------] \nis our Group CTO), plugged in the hard drive and checked the code. As soon as he\nopened the README file, the first line was mvn install -DskipTest\n\nThe code had *never* been tested.\n\nIn other words, the code was live without ever passing a single quality check.\nThe old codebase was called Stan Marsh\n[https://blog.gojekengineering.com/thank-you-stan-marsh-29db553544bf]. For the\nuninitiated, Stan Marsh is a character from South Park, and if you watch the\nshow, you‚Äôd get the obvious reference to the famous line:\n\n> ‚ÄúDude, this is pretty f****d up right here.‚Äù\nAnd thus it came to be. Stan Marsh was the legacy code on which GOJEK was going\nto be built. Because there was no test harness, it was difficult to understand\nwhich portion of the app was working, and which wasn‚Äôt. Considering the app was\nlive, no one wanted to touch a ticking time bomb. It was‚Ä¶ sorry, is‚Ä¶ very much\npart of engineering folklore. (More on that later)\n\nAs urban legends go, Niranjan re-wrote the entire codebase in Golang, a language\nhe didn‚Äôt know. Three nights. A dozen Redbulls. Two dozen coffees. Golang could\nhandle concurrency, manage load; the kind GOJEK was witnessing. The mothership\nwas ready. Or so the team thought.\n\nIt wasn‚Äôt an easy decision to go with Golang. Not many knew the programming\nlanguage. But some risks are worth taking ‚Äî and that defines good engineering\nfrom great.

It‚Äôs a holy tree whose branches touch the heavens. The gods hold court beneath <em><em>Yggdrasil ‚Äî </em></em>debating the fates of other gods, men and monsters. It‚Äôs the tree of life and the centre of everything in Norse mythology. In GOJEK, think of the <strong><strong><em><em>`Allocations` </em></em></strong></strong>team as this eternal green ash tree. Our multiple products rely on this team to assign drivers to complete orders.</p><p>The team cuts across products and services responsible for 1,000,000+ registered drivers on our platform.</p><p><strong>And 12 engineers do this.</strong></p><p>A similar ride-sharing equivalent has 300-odd people solving the same problem and still does fewer bookings. But how do they do it? This is their story.</p><h2 id=\"on-planet-earth-problems-galore\">On planet Earth, problems galore</h2><p>When GOJEK started in 2010, it all began with a call centre. Customers would call a number, the call centre would ‚Äòallocate‚Äô a driver after <em><em>looking at an Excel sheet of drivers</em></em> in the roster. Our CEO Nadiem Makarim was the first person to test the app built for drivers and customers. As soon as a dummy order was created and Nadiem got the first notification, GOJEK was open for business.</p><p>At its peak in 2014, GOJEK had 200 drivers. The 3-person engineering team had a basic stop-gap model of matchmaking between a driver and a customer. This codebase had to be reworked to match scale. The new matchmaking codebase was built in two days and could handle about 700 drivers. It was all manual and something had to be done to <a href=\"https://blog.gojekengineering.com/how-we-do-what-we-do-at-go-jek-tech-d1d5d952e13\" rel=\"noopener\">automate</a> the whole process.</p><p>In the beginning of 2015, a version of the app was launched to keep pace with increasing demand. GO-RIDE, GO-FOOD and GO-SEND went live. Customers would ‚Äòbid‚Äô for a driver, drivers would get a notification, accept a drive and voila, we‚Äôre good to go. This was the birth of the ‚Äò<strong><strong>bid engine‚Äô ‚Äî a classic matchmaker between supply and demand:</strong></strong> Driver and Customer. <em><em>It would form the genesis on which GOJEK was going to be built</em></em>. The problem: siloed boxes.</p><p>There were a total of three products with the same underlying infrastructure, but no interconnectedness. THAT was a problem that shouldn‚Äôt exist when success depends on deeper linkage between all teams. This problem is further pronounced when you realise all three teams were working on the same infrastructure.</p><p><em><em>Importantly, GOJEK simply wasn‚Äôt prepared to handle the kind of adoption and growth the company began to witness as soon as the app was launched.</em></em></p><p>The algorithm started to crumble. The engineering was pretty straightforward with 10‚Äì15 lines of code, and solved problems for a small set of data. As the drivers increased, downtimes became a routine affair. There were way too many bottlenecks. <strong><strong>GOJEK was failing, and fast.</strong></strong></p><p>Soon, Sequoia had mutual investment portfolios and unlocked some doors. Sidu Ponnappa, our current India Head, then the CEO of CodeMonk, travelled to Indonesia to pick between three of Sequoia‚Äôs companies. The team‚Äôs ultimate decision to work with GOJEK is not entirely surprising because it was bigger, larger than anything they had witnessed in India. The market was ripe for the taking. Read his telling tale from his first visit to Indonesia <a href=\"https://blog.gojekengineering.com/my-go-jek-story-af5f1925bfe\" rel=\"noopener\">here.</a></p><p><em><em>In no time, Nadiem acquired CodeMonk. But before that, our current CTO, Niranjan Paranjappe was being poached. <em>? </em>The team stood together. It was all, or none.</em></em></p><p>And Nadiem wanted all. <strong><strong>The deal was closed in a small tea shop</strong></strong> between Sidu, Niranjan, Nadiem, Ajey and Kevin. Overnight, GOJEK had one of India‚Äôs best consulting firms in its arsenal. The task for the engineering team: Work on the bidding engine. No more downtimes.</p><h2 id=\"it-s-the-0-s-and-1-s\">It‚Äôs the 0‚Äôs and 1‚Äôs</h2><p>The old codebase was written in Java. It‚Äôs a programming language that belonged to the Internet age. But not for a startup in 2015 that was exploding in demand and imploding with a lack of resources and engineering wherewithal. Why Java? Because, the classic <strong><strong>Golden Hammer Anti-Pattern:</strong></strong></p><p><em><em>‚ÄúIf all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.‚Äù And hence, ‚ÄòI know Java, so Java is the best.‚Äô</em></em></p><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/u/689ebe477c46?source=post_page-----978af9ccfd32----------------------\" rel=\"noopener\">Niranjan Paranjape</a>, our now CTO (<a href=\"https://medium.com/u/bb9ef62c7bae?source=post_page-----978af9ccfd32----------------------\" rel=\"noopener\">Ajey Gore</a> is our Group CTO), plugged in the hard drive and checked the code. As soon as he opened the README file, the first line was mvn install -DskipTest</p><p><strong><strong>The code had *<em><em>never</em></em>* been tested.</strong></strong></p><p>In other words, the code was live without ever passing a single quality check. The old codebase was called <a href=\"https://blog.gojekengineering.com/thank-you-stan-marsh-29db553544bf\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong><strong>Stan Marsh</strong></strong></a><strong><strong>.</strong></strong> For the uninitiated, Stan Marsh is a character from South Park, and if you watch the show, you‚Äôd get the obvious reference to the famous line:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1600/1*Mk4tc6cfIHlC_f1CblNGNQ.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><blockquote><em><em>‚ÄúDude, this is pretty f****d up right here.‚Äù</em></em></blockquote><p>And thus it came to be. <strong><strong>Stan Marsh was the legacy code on which GOJEK was going to be built</strong></strong>. Because there was no test harness, it was difficult to understand which portion of the app was working, and which wasn‚Äôt. Considering the app was live, no one wanted to touch a ticking time bomb. It was‚Ä¶ sorry, is‚Ä¶ very much part of engineering folklore. (More on that later)</p><p>As urban legends go, Niranjan re-wrote the entire codebase in Golang, a language he didn‚Äôt know. Three nights. A dozen Redbulls. Two dozen coffees. Golang could handle concurrency, manage load; the kind GOJEK was witnessing. The mothership was ready. Or so the team thought.</p><p>It wasn‚Äôt an easy decision to go with Golang. Not many knew the programming language. But some risks are worth taking ‚Äî and that defines good engineering from great. Luckily, this initial decision-making set the tone for the team; learn, experiment, adapt, take responsibility or be disrupted. In a month, GOJEK‚Äôs driver count tripled. But‚Ä¶ there were more problems to come. Bigger fish to fry.</p><p>For Part 2 of the story, please click <a href=\"https://blog.gojekengineering.com/how-go-jek-manages-1-million-drivers-with-12-engineers-part-2-35f6a27a0faf\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a></p><hr><p>Story credits: <a href=\"https://medium.com/u/e5f92a17704d?source=post_page-----978af9ccfd32----------------------\" rel=\"noopener\">Shobhit Srivastava</a>, <a href=\"https://medium.com/u/710d3b419a5a?source=post_page-----978af9ccfd32----------------------\" rel=\"noopener\">Ranjeet Singh</a>, <a href=\"https://medium.com/u/36ce12a82c52?source=post_page-----978af9ccfd32----------------------\" rel=\"noopener\">Mehakdeep Singh</a>, <a href=\"https://medium.com/u/5cffcceadf08?source=post_page-----978af9ccfd32----------------------\" rel=\"noopener\">Bergas Bimo Branarto</a></p>","url":"https://gojek-ghost.zysk.in/how-gojek-manages-1-million-drivers-with-12-engineers-part-1/","canonical_url":null,"uuid":"ba3d779e-27f2-41a6-ac1d-cd753222d7dd","page":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_styles":null,"comment_id":"5eb12b71f7c7da001effcdbe","reading_time":4}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"why-we-swear-by-the-rca"}}}
