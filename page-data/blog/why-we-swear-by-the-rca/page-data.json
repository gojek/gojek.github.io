As we spread out from Jakarta,\nsatiating the hunger of millions of customers in most parts of Indonesia, GoFood\nas a product got increasingly complicated. Orders started to pile up, and we\nwere struggling to keep up with the skyrocketing demand. If we wanted to keep up\nwith users‚Äô expectations, a few things needed to be done. We had to change, and\nsimultaneously up our game.\n\nIt‚Äôs a VUCA world, and we often remind ourselves that not a lot of things are\nconstant. We‚Äôve been working hard to reimagine, re-engineer and redesign the\nGoFood flow which hasn‚Äôt been altered too much for many years.\n\nTo help you understand how it all started, let‚Äôs take you back in time a little\nbit‚Ä¶\n\nWhen the Gojek app for ride-hailing was launched in early 2015, we noticed there\nwere times when our driver partners had lean work periods. To provide additional\nmeans to help them make use of this time and earn more, GoSend (to send\ncouriers) and GoShop (to buy anything) were launched as auxiliary services.\n\n> We noticed that majority of orders placed in GoShop were for food. This gave way\nto GoFood, our dedicated food delivery product, launched in mid-2015.\nPhase 1: Listing Model\nGoFood started as a concierge model, where we had no tie-ups with restaurants. A\nSalesforce was deployed to list as many restaurant menus as possible on our\nplatform. When a customer placed an order, it would be assigned to one of our\ndriver partners, who would then go and place the order at the restaurant. The\ndriver partner would wait around, and when the order was ready, pay in cash,\npickup the order and deliver it to the customer.\n\nTedious? Yes. Scalable? No. ü§∑‚Äç\n\n\nPhase 2: Partnering With Merchants\nTo arrive at a scalable solution, we realised we had to take the restaurant\nmerchants along with us in this journey and welcome them into our ecosystem. We\nstarted partnering with the merchants, who were known as ‚ÄòGoFood Partners‚Äô.\n\n> This not only helped our merchants grow their businesses, but also got ample\nvisibility boost on GoFood.\nEven after onboarding them into our ecosystem, a large part of the process was\nmanual. It was far from ideal because there was no record of transactions\nbesides a booking on GoFood and a receipt handed to the driver partner.\n\nOften there were discrepancies in the number of orders assigned and the number\nof orders completed. How, you ask?\n\nImagine a GoFood partner who is part of a large chain of restaurants. When\nsomeone orders food from this chain, GoFood assigns this order to one outlet.\nHowever, the driver partner may decide to visit another outlet and pick up the\norder, as per convenience.\n\nThere were more problems galore.\n\nIf a merchant partner was not open for business on a particular day, and wanted\nto update their menu, or indicate items as out of stock, they had to call the\nGojek Customer Care. During this time, orders would still be coming in, which\nresulted in driver partners accepting orders that most certainly couldn‚Äôt be\ncompleted without a hassle.\n\nThere was a lot that needed fixing here, and it could only be done by\nintegrating merchants more deeply into our ecosystem. So, that‚Äôs exactly what we\ndid.\n\nPhase 3: The merchant app, GoResto\nTowards the end of 2016, a concept was developed for an app that would cater to\nmerchant partners, and by early 2017 GoResto (which is what we called it at the\ntime) was ready.\n\nWe introduced the following in GoResto:\n\n1. Electronic payments\nAll of Gojek‚Äôs driver partners had GoPay e-wallets associated with their\naccounts. With GoResto, we did the same for our GoFood partners. Transactions\nbetween driver and GoFood partners was directly wallet-to-wallet, hence,\ncashless.\n\n2. PIN exchange for restaurant verification\nTo ensure the order is secured, driver partners would also need to share a PIN\nwith the merchant while picking up the order. This electronic handshake helped\nus verify they were indeed picking up the right order from the right outlet.\n\n3. Catalog management\nWe noticed a lot of cancellations were happening because the items were either\nout of stock, restaurants were closed or customers were generally skeptical\nabout ordering dishes that didn‚Äôt have enough reference images. So, we started\nfocussing more on improving the product experience for our customers and BCR\n(booking completion rate). Catalog management was introduced so that the\nmerchants could regularly update details that customers saw on GoFood. For\nexample: Availability status of dishes that were put on the menu, uploading\ndetails pertaining to different items sold, etc.\n\nIn the meanwhile, GoResto was rebranded to GoBiz. What started off as a product\nthat helped merchants to manage their food orders, started evolving into\nsomething bigger. Since the scope extended beyond GoFood, calling it ‚ÄòGoResto‚Äô\nmade no sense.\n\nThe rebranding came with enhanced features in GoBiz. As you might‚Äôve guessed, it\nalso came with new, enhanced problems and a sub-optimal flow:\n\n‚ö†Ô∏è The driver partner was ready, but the food wasn‚Äôt\n> The average time taken for a driver partner was:\n~9 minutes to pick up an order\n~19 minutes to deliver the order\nA portion of this time was spent by the driver waiting for the food to be\nprepared, because in most cases, GoFood partners started preparing food only\nafter the driver arrived! This was mostly because customer would add more food\nitems or the ordered items would be out of stock. We figured that the driver\narrival time could be parallelised with the food prep time. This led to 2\nimportant things:\n\n * Overall delivery time for the customer could be reduced\n * Wait time for the driver could be utilised to fulfil other orders\n\nÔ∏èÔ∏èÔ∏è‚ö†Ô∏è GoFood Partner-driven cancellations existed, accountability didn‚Äôt\nGoFood partners had the ability to set their open hours and change item\navailability, but they didn‚Äôt always keep it updated. When cancellations\npertaining to these reasons happened, they were handled by‚Ä¶the driver partners.\nü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è\nThis meant, the orders had to be cancelled either by the driver partners or the\ncustomers themselves.\n\n> Items being out of stock or restaurants being closed accounted for over 35% of\nall customer cancellations after a driver was assigned.\nOn the driver side, these accounted for over 75% of all driver cancellations. üòì\n‚ö†Ô∏è Price edits became pricey\nIn this order flow, the driver placed the final order with the merchant. This\nessentially means that the original order placed by the customer could be\nmodified due to various reasons: Incorrect listing of price, unavailability of\nitems, adding new items to the order, etc. To accommodate these cases, drivers\nwere allowed to input to final price of the order, leading to a price edit.\n\nAnd price edits aren‚Äôt uncommon. They happen to ~34% of the orders.\n\nMultiple moving pieces exposed these orders to skip payments or consumer wallet\nsweeps.\n\nPhase 4: Introducing Merchant Acceptance Flow\nDue to various reasons, our driver partners were handling GoFood partner-driven\ncancellations and heavy-lifting to ensure the orders were fulfilled. This, too,\nhad to change.\n\nAfter brainstorming, mind-mapping and head-scratching, we arrived at Merchant\nAccept Flow (MAF). The merchants who are onboarded to MAF are called Super\nPartners. The solution lets our Super Partners accept/reject orders based on the\nrestaurant being open, availability of items, or any other factors that\ndetermine order fulfilment or cancellation. This in turn helps our customers and\ndriver partners know that the merchant is preparing food for sure, so that there\nare no customer or driver cancellations.\n\nIn Part-2 of this blog, we‚Äôll dive deep into Merchant Acceptance Flow, how we\nwent about designing it and introducing Super Partners to our customers.

Orders started to pile up, and we were struggling to keep up with the skyrocketing demand. If we wanted to keep up with users‚Äô expectations, a few things needed to be done. We had to change, and simultaneously up our game.</p><p>It‚Äôs a VUCA world, and we often remind ourselves that not a lot of things are constant. We‚Äôve been working hard to reimagine, re-engineer and redesign the GoFood flow which hasn‚Äôt been altered too much for many years.</p><p>To help you understand how it all started, let‚Äôs take you back in time a little bit‚Ä¶</p><p>When the Gojek app for ride-hailing was launched in early 2015, we noticed there were times when our driver partners had lean work periods. To provide additional means to help them make use of this time and earn more, GoSend (to send couriers) and GoShop (to buy anything) were launched as auxiliary services.</p><blockquote>We noticed that majority of orders placed in GoShop were for food. This gave way to GoFood, our dedicated food delivery product, launched in mid-2015.</blockquote><h3 id=\"phase-1-listing-model\">Phase 1: Listing Model</h3><p>GoFood started as a concierge model, where we had no tie-ups with restaurants. A Salesforce was deployed to list as many restaurant menus as possible on our platform. When a customer placed an order, it would be assigned to one of our driver partners, who would then go and place the order at the restaurant. The driver partner would wait around, and when the order was ready, pay in cash, pickup the order and deliver it to the customer.</p><h3 id=\"tedious-yes-scalable-no-\"><em>Tedious? Yes. Scalable? No. ü§∑‚Äç</em></h3><p></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://gojek-ghost.zysk.in/content/images/2020/06/image-16.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><h3 id=\"phase-2-partnering-with-merchants\">Phase 2: Partnering With Merchants</h3><p>To arrive at a scalable solution, we realised we had to take the restaurant merchants along with us in this journey and welcome them into our ecosystem. We started partnering with the merchants, who were known as ‚Äò<strong><em>GoFood Partners</em></strong>‚Äô.</p><blockquote>This not only helped our merchants grow their businesses, but also got ample visibility boost on GoFood.</blockquote><p>Even after onboarding them into our ecosystem, a large part of the process was manual. It was far from ideal because there was no record of transactions besides a booking on GoFood and a receipt handed to the driver partner.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://gojek-ghost.zysk.in/content/images/2020/06/image-17.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>Often there were discrepancies in the number of orders assigned and the number of orders completed. How, you ask?</p><p>Imagine a GoFood partner who is part of a large chain of restaurants. When someone orders food from this chain, GoFood assigns this order to one outlet. However, the driver partner may decide to visit another outlet and pick up the order, as per convenience.</p><h3 id=\"there-were-more-problems-galore-\"><em>There were more problems galore.</em><br></h3><p>If a merchant partner was not open for business on a particular day, and wanted to update their menu, or indicate items as out of stock, they had to call the Gojek Customer Care. During this time, orders would still be coming in, which resulted in driver partners accepting orders that most certainly couldn‚Äôt be completed without a hassle.</p><p>There was a lot that needed fixing here, and it could only be done by integrating merchants more deeply into our ecosystem. So, that‚Äôs exactly what we did.</p><h3 id=\"phase-3-the-merchant-app-goresto\">Phase 3: The merchant app, GoResto</h3><p>Towards the end of 2016, a concept was developed for an app that would cater to merchant partners, and by early 2017 GoResto (which is what we called it at the time) was ready.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://gojek-ghost.zysk.in/content/images/2020/06/image-18.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>We introduced the following in GoResto:</p><h4 id=\"1-electronic-payments\">1. Electronic payments</h4><p>All of Gojek‚Äôs driver partners had GoPay e-wallets associated with their accounts. With GoResto, we did the same for our GoFood partners. Transactions between driver and GoFood partners was directly wallet-to-wallet, hence, cashless.</p><h4 id=\"2-pin-exchange-for-restaurant-verification\">2. PIN exchange for restaurant verification</h4><p>To ensure the order is secured, driver partners would also need to share a PIN with the merchant while picking up the order. This electronic handshake helped us verify they were indeed picking up the right order from the right outlet.</p><h4 id=\"3-catalog-management\">3. Catalog management</h4><p>We noticed a lot of cancellations were happening because the items were either out of stock, restaurants were closed or customers were generally skeptical about ordering dishes that didn‚Äôt have enough reference images. So, we started focussing more on improving the product experience for our customers and BCR (booking completion rate). Catalog management was introduced so that the merchants could regularly update details that customers saw on GoFood. For example: Availability status of dishes that were put on the menu, uploading details pertaining to different items sold, etc.</p><p>In the meanwhile, GoResto was rebranded to GoBiz. What started off as a product that helped merchants to manage their food orders, started evolving into something bigger. Since the scope extended beyond GoFood, calling it ‚ÄòGoResto‚Äô made no sense.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*UTfTFeb5u4dc8PbMRnyYtA.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>The rebranding came with enhanced features in GoBiz. As you might‚Äôve guessed, it also came with new, enhanced problems and a sub-optimal flow:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*7ZHFNcogEuyAGZ86zomAuw.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><h4 id=\"-the-driver-partner-was-ready-but-the-food-wasn-t\">‚ö†Ô∏è The driver partner was ready, but the food wasn‚Äôt</h4><blockquote>The average time taken for a driver partner was:<br>~9 minutes to pick up an order<br>~19 minutes to deliver the order</blockquote><p>A portion of this time was spent by the driver waiting for the food to be prepared, because in most cases, GoFood partners started preparing food only after the driver arrived! This was mostly because customer would add more food items or the ordered items would be out of stock. We figured that the driver arrival time could be parallelised with the food prep time. This led to 2 important things:</p><ul><li>Overall delivery time for the customer could be reduced</li><li>Wait time for the driver could be utilised to fulfil other orders</li></ul><h4 id=\"-gofood-partner-driven-cancellations-existed-accountability-didn-t\">Ô∏èÔ∏èÔ∏è‚ö†Ô∏è GoFood Partner-driven cancellations existed, accountability didn‚Äôt</h4><p>GoFood partners had the ability to set their open hours and change item availability, but they didn‚Äôt always keep it updated. When cancellations pertaining to these reasons happened, they were handled by‚Ä¶the driver partners. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è<br>This meant, the orders had to be cancelled either by the driver partners or the customers themselves.</p><blockquote>Items being out of stock or restaurants being closed accounted for over 35% of all customer cancellations after a driver was assigned.<br>On the driver side, these accounted for over 75% of all driver cancellations. üòì</blockquote><h4 id=\"-price-edits-became-pricey\">‚ö†Ô∏è Price edits became pricey</h4><p>In this order flow, the driver placed the final order with the merchant. This essentially means that the original order placed by the customer could be modified due to various reasons: Incorrect listing of price, unavailability of items, adding new items to the order, etc. To accommodate these cases, drivers were allowed to input to final price of the order, leading to a price edit.</p><h3 id=\"and-price-edits-aren-t-uncommon-they-happen-to-34-of-the-orders-\"><em>And price edits aren‚Äôt uncommon. They happen to ~34% of the orders.</em></h3><p><br>Multiple moving pieces exposed these orders to skip payments or consumer wallet sweeps.</p><h3 id=\"phase-4-introducing-merchant-acceptance-flow\">Phase 4: Introducing Merchant Acceptance Flow</h3><p>Due to various reasons, our driver partners were handling GoFood partner-driven cancellations and heavy-lifting to ensure the orders were fulfilled. This, too, had to change.</p><p>After brainstorming, mind-mapping and head-scratching, we arrived at Merchant Accept Flow (MAF). The merchants who are onboarded to MAF are called Super Partners. The solution lets our Super Partners accept/reject orders based on the restaurant being open, availability of items, or any other factors that determine order fulfilment or cancellation. This in turn helps our customers and driver partners know that the merchant is preparing food for sure, so that there are no customer or driver cancellations.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*5FbUDwJLqdnyjJIPwbaOYQ.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>In Part-2 of this blog, we‚Äôll dive deep into Merchant Acceptance Flow, how we went about designing it and introducing Super Partners to our customers.

How do such diverse people come together and build\namazing things? That‚Äôs where Program Management comes into the picture.\n\nThe Challenge\nGoMerchants PDG was formed from five separate teams (SPOTS, Midtrans, Mapan,\nGoResto, Nadipos), and each team had a unique engineering culture. Across teams,\nthe total number of staff involved in cross-functional work was ~240 people.\n\nAfter a discovery phase of the process over 3 months with the various groups, we\nfound that every team was utilising different versions of project management\nmethodology and tools to track team progress. Across various teams, we\nidentified nearly a dozen different types of tools and methods including the\nScrum method, Kanban method, Jira tools, Favro Tools, and Trello tools.\n\nThe key takeaway was clear: There was no single source of truth for tracking\nteam deployment progress.\n\nThe Solution\nTo achieve our goal of reaching a high rate of (quality) deliverables with clear\ntransparency on progress, the Program Managers decided to build a program that\nset a single standard workflow for everyone involved.

It starts from Pre-Iteration Planning\nMeeting (Pre-IPM), Retrospective, IPM/Sprint Planning, and Daily Standup:\n\nSprints\nA Sprint is a time-box of iterations, where the releasable works that align with\nsprint goals are implemented. A Sprint always has a fixed start and end date ‚Äî\nthese dates should be of the same duration; typically two weeks.\n\nSource: Essential Scrum: A Practical Guide to the Most Popular Agile Process\nSprints notes: While most of GoMerchants PDG uses two-week sprints, the length\nof time can depend on several factors like the final deadline, number of people\nin the team, and holidays in the calendar. Some teams use a one-week Sprint\ncycle due to urgent work that requires moving at an accelerated pace. But,\ngenerally it is not a best practice to use one-week sprint cycles as team\nachievement moments can be missed, quality could be sacrificed, and team\nburn-out is a real risk.\n\nPre-I.P.M. (Pre-Iteration Planning Meeting)\nPre-IPM is an activity to review the active Sprint and manage backlog and Sprint\ngoal(s) for the next iteration. Pre-IPM is attended by a Product Manager, Tech\nLeads, and Program Manager. The Product Manager should write-up the ‚Äòstory‚Äô aka\nplan, in Jira after Pre-IPM. Tech lead should advise if the story and goals for\nthe next iteration are technically achievable.\n\nAs a Program Manager, you can use spreadsheets for mapping between the story and\nteam before doing the IPM. Below is the example:\n\nPre-IPM notes: This is basically a small meeting with a PM, TechLead, HoE/HoP\n(if necessary) and PgM. The purpose is to finalise the work backlog for the team\nin the upcoming Sprint. This meeting will help streamline the Sprint Planning\nmeeting by confirming that the final requirements have been aligned by all\nstakeholders ‚Äî the goal being to reduce the number of ‚ÄúRequirement Changes‚Äù\ngoing forward. .\n\nRetrospective\nThe purpose of a retrospective in IPM is to collect previous sprint feedback\nfrom the team. It contains some columns like:\n\n * Glad: What makes you happy in this sprint or things that went well\n * Sad: What makes you sad in this sprint and from here we can see how we can\n   improve it\n * Mad: What makes you mad or frustrated in this sprint\n * Ideas: Idea to improve our next sprint\n * Appreciation: Appreciation in this sprint, esp if there‚Äôs a pretty big team\n   achievement\n * Action Item: Action item to improve our next sprint based on Sad, Mad, and\n   Ideas columns. This is the important part to be followed up so ‚Äúlesson\n   learned‚Äù value from every sprint is really working\n\nWe can use several tools to help us collect data, i.e. https://funretro.io/,\nbelow is the example:\n\nSend a retrospective link to a Slack channel before IPM and encourage the team\nto fill the cards. Do the retrospective by talking through each column 15‚Äì30\nminutes before IPM starts.\n\nRetrospective notes: This session provides the opportunity for a team to look\nback and see how they can improve. Retrospectives can be a catalyst for\norganisational change, team change or even a culture change. The Retrospective\ncan be a place to build and enable teams, or to help teams start their journey\nwith a clear understanding of where to go next. It‚Äôs a method that is very\nuseful to gauge the Team Happiness state and gain Improvement Feedback from the\nteam. A Retrospective also builds trust and helps make the team grow stronger as\nindividual members know they have an outlet to express their feedback and they\nwill be heard by their managers and colleagues. Since this process is highly\nactionable, the PgM‚Äôs have incorporated it beyond the use case of small teams,\nand have instituted it at larger scale for the entire GoMerchants PDG Org every\n6 months.\n\nIPM/Sprint Planning\nIPM/Sprint Planning is an activity that is attended by all members of the team\nto prioritise the backlog, discuss stories, and determine story points.\n\nSource: http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1928232Below are the\nsteps taken in an IPM:\n\nBefore IPM:\n\n * Program Manager sends a retrospective link to a Slack channel\n\nDuring IPM:\n\n * Retrospective 15 min\n * Open Sprint Report to review active sprint (Done and Not Done)\n * Complete Sprint\n * Open velocity chart to review the commitment and complete stories from the\n   previous Sprint\n * Ask the team who will take a leave and discuss with PM about achievement\n   story (this will be helpful to adjust velocity for the next Sprint)\n * The PM explains each story for a new sprint.

What obstacles are impeding my\n   progress? What will I do by the next daily standup?\n * Daily Stand up notes: There are times people will forget to update Jira\n   ticket (it‚Äôs a never-ending challenge üíÅ). As a Program Manager, we need to\n   remind/ensure their team updates Jira (at least) right beforethe stand up\n   starts.\n\nThe Results\nWe‚Äôll let them speak for themselves!\n\nH1 & H2 2019 resultAfter building a standard approach across teams using Agile,\nJira, and other tool sets, the Program Management approach used by the\nGoMerchants PgM team to combine these elements helped to vastly improve the\neffectiveness of team performance on 2019 period.

This new investment will support\nGojek‚Äôs mission to boost Southeast Asia‚Äôs digital economy, with a focus on\nsupporting payments and financial services in the region.\n\nWith digital payments adoption primed to accelerate exponentially, the resources\nfrom some of the world‚Äôs leading global tech businesses will be combined with\nthe local focus and technology of Gojek.\n\nThis benefits millions of businesses and people across Indonesia and other parts\nof Southeast Asia.\n\nGojek‚Äôs payments business, GoPay, has long been focused on increasing access to\nthe digital economy among micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), the\nmajority of which continue to rely on cash to operate, due to the region‚Äôs large\nunbanked population. The latest influx of funding will support more of these\nbusinesses as they seek to digitise further, from micro-merchants selling wares\non the street side, up to large businesses looking to strengthen their digital\npayment infrastructure.\n\nSince launching its app in 2015, Gojek has digitised hundreds of thousands of\nmerchants on its platform, providing them with access to more than 170 million\nusers across Southeast Asia. Its payments business processes billions of\ntransactions each year and owns the largest e-wallet in Indonesia. A large part\nof this is driven by GoFood, the largest food delivery service in Indonesia, as\nwell as the expansion of GoPay into other sectors both within and outside the\nGojek ecosystem.\n\nGojek Co-CEO, Andre Soelistyo, said:\n\n> This is great validation that the world‚Äôs most innovative tech companies\nrecognise the positive impact Gojek is making in Indonesia and the whole of\nSoutheast Asia. By working together, we have the opportunity to achieve\nsomething truly unique as we aim to help more businesses to digitise and ensure\nthat many millions more consumers are enjoying the benefits that the digital\neconomy can bring.\n> The COVID-19 pandemic and its associated issues have served as a tough reminder\nthat if our economies are to be more resilient, they must be underpinned by\ndigital infrastructure that diversifies the ways in which people can live and\ntransact. We see our role as a convener of global tech expertise, facilitating\ncollaboration that will ultimately lead to a better future for everyone in our\nregion.\nGojek Co-CEO, Kevin Aluwi, added:\n\n> Since we were founded, the story of Gojek‚Äôs growth has been inexorably linked\nwith the growth of the micro-entrepreneurs and small businesses on our platform\nand this will always be the case. With some of the world‚Äôs best technology\ncompanies as partners, we are confident that we can continue to deliver unique\nworld-class products and services for the various players in our ecosystem.\nFacebook‚Äôs investment is the first it has made in an Indonesia-based business as\nit seeks to create new opportunities for businesses in the country, including\nthrough its ubiquitous Whatsapp service.\n\nMatt Idema, Chief Operating Officer at WhatsApp, said: ‚ÄúGojek, WhatsApp and\nFacebook are indispensable services in Indonesia. Working together we can help\nbring millions of small businesses and the customers they serve into the largest\ndigital economy in Southeast Asia.‚Äù\n\nAs part of its commercial agreement, PayPal‚Äôs payment capabilities will be\nintegrated into Gojek‚Äôs services and the two companies will also collaborate to\nallow customers of GoPay, Gojek‚Äôs digital wallet, to gain access to PayPal‚Äôs\nnetwork of more than 25 million merchants around the world.\n\nFarhad Maleki, Head of Corporate Development and Ventures for APAC at PayPal,\nsaid: ‚ÄúSoutheast Asia is at an inflection point in digital adoption that creates\nnew opportunities to deliver financial services to previously unbanked merchants\nand consumers. We could not be more excited about entering into this strategic\nrelationship with Gojek to expand access and provide new experiences for our\ncollective customers in this dynamic market and around the world.‚Äù\n\nGoogle and Tencent are longstanding investors in Gojek. Both companies have\ncollaborated on multiple Gojek projects since their first investments in 2018.\n\nCaesar Sengupta, VP, Payments and Next Billion Users, Google, said: ‚ÄúGojek‚Äôs\ninnovation and technologies have had an incredible impact in making life more\nconvenient for Indonesians across the country and in bringing its MSMEs online.\nWe‚Äôre pleased to continue to invest in and enable Gojek in its journey. Gojek‚Äôs\nsuccess points to the strength of the region‚Äôs internet economy and the\ninnovation in its start-up ecosystem.‚Äù\n\nJeffrey Li, Vice President of Tencent Holdings and Managing Partner of Tencent\nInvestment, said, ‚ÄúGojek is effectively promoting digitization and financially\nenabling small businesses.

The latest influx of funding will support more of these businesses as they seek to digitise further, from micro-merchants selling wares on the street side, up to large businesses looking to strengthen their digital payment infrastructure.</p><p>Since launching its app in 2015, Gojek has digitised hundreds of thousands of merchants on its platform, providing them with access to more than 170 million users across Southeast Asia. Its payments business processes billions of transactions each year and owns the largest e-wallet in Indonesia. A large part of this is driven by GoFood, the largest food delivery service in Indonesia, as well as the expansion of GoPay into other sectors both within and outside the Gojek ecosystem.</p><p><strong><strong>Gojek Co-CEO, Andre Soelistyo</strong></strong>, said:</p><blockquote><em><em>This is great validation that the world‚Äôs most innovative tech companies recognise the positive impact Gojek is making in Indonesia and the whole of Southeast Asia. By working together, we have the opportunity to achieve something truly unique as we aim to help more businesses to digitise and ensure that many millions more consumers are enjoying the benefits that the digital economy can bring.</em></em></blockquote><blockquote><em><em>The COVID-19 pandemic and its associated issues have served as a tough reminder that if our economies are to be more resilient, they must be underpinned by digital infrastructure that diversifies the ways in which people can live and transact. We see our role as a convener of global tech expertise, facilitating collaboration that will ultimately lead to a better future for everyone in our region.</em></em></blockquote><p><strong><strong>Gojek Co-CEO, Kevin Aluwi</strong></strong>, added:</p><blockquote><em><em>Since we were founded, the story of Gojek‚Äôs growth has been inexorably linked with the growth of the micro-entrepreneurs and small businesses on our platform and this will always be the case. With some of the world‚Äôs best technology companies as partners, we are confident that we can continue to deliver unique world-class products and services for the various players in our ecosystem.</em></em></blockquote><p>Facebook‚Äôs investment is the first it has made in an Indonesia-based business as it seeks to create new opportunities for businesses in the country, including through its ubiquitous Whatsapp service.</p><p><strong><strong>Matt Idema, Chief Operating Officer at WhatsApp</strong></strong>, said: ‚ÄúGojek, WhatsApp and Facebook are indispensable services in Indonesia. Working together we can help bring millions of small businesses and the customers they serve into the largest digital economy in Southeast Asia.‚Äù</p><p>As part of its commercial agreement, PayPal‚Äôs payment capabilities will be integrated into Gojek‚Äôs services and the two companies will also collaborate to allow customers of GoPay, Gojek‚Äôs digital wallet, to gain access to PayPal‚Äôs network of more than 25 million merchants around the world.</p><p><strong><strong>Farhad Maleki, Head of Corporate Development and Ventures for APAC at PayPal</strong></strong>, said: ‚ÄúSoutheast Asia is at an inflection point in digital adoption that creates new opportunities to deliver financial services to previously unbanked merchants and consumers. We could not be more excited about entering into this strategic relationship with Gojek to expand access and provide new experiences for our collective customers in this dynamic market and around the world.‚Äù</p><p>Google and Tencent are longstanding investors in Gojek. Both companies have collaborated on multiple Gojek projects since their first investments in 2018.</p><p><strong><strong>Caesar Sengupta, VP, Payments and Next Billion Users, Google</strong></strong>, said: ‚ÄúGojek‚Äôs innovation and technologies have had an incredible impact in making life more convenient for Indonesians across the country and in bringing its MSMEs online. We‚Äôre pleased to continue to invest in and enable Gojek in its journey. Gojek‚Äôs success points to the strength of the region‚Äôs internet economy and the innovation in its start-up ecosystem.‚Äù</p><p><strong><strong>Jeffrey Li, Vice President of Tencent Holdings and Managing Partner of Tencent Investment</strong></strong>, said, ‚ÄúGojek is effectively promoting digitization and financially enabling small businesses. We‚Äôre glad to strengthen our partnership through the increased investment and we look forward to further collaboration with Gojek.‚Äù</p><h3 id=\"about-gojek-group\">About Gojek Group</h3><p>Gojek is Southeast Asia‚Äôs leading technology group and a pioneer of the integrated Super App and ecosystem model.

The 3-person engineering team had a\nbasic stop-gap model of matchmaking between a driver and a customer. This\ncodebase had to be reworked to match scale. The new matchmaking codebase was\nbuilt in two days and could handle about 700 drivers. It was all manual and\nsomething had to be done to automate\n[https://blog.gojekengineering.com/how-we-do-what-we-do-at-go-jek-tech-d1d5d952e13] \nthe whole process.\n\nIn the beginning of 2015, a version of the app was launched to keep pace with\nincreasing demand. GO-RIDE, GO-FOOD and GO-SEND went live. Customers would ‚Äòbid‚Äô\nfor a driver, drivers would get a notification, accept a drive and voila, we‚Äôre\ngood to go. This was the birth of the ‚Äòbid engine‚Äô ‚Äî a classic matchmaker\nbetween supply and demand: Driver and Customer. It would form the genesis on\nwhich GOJEK was going to be built. The problem: siloed boxes.\n\nThere were a total of three products with the same underlying infrastructure,\nbut no interconnectedness. THAT was a problem that shouldn‚Äôt exist when success\ndepends on deeper linkage between all teams. This problem is further pronounced\nwhen you realise all three teams were working on the same infrastructure.\n\nImportantly, GOJEK simply wasn‚Äôt prepared to handle the kind of adoption and\ngrowth the company began to witness as soon as the app was launched.\n\nThe algorithm started to crumble. The engineering was pretty straightforward\nwith 10‚Äì15 lines of code, and solved problems for a small set of data. As the\ndrivers increased, downtimes became a routine affair. There were way too many\nbottlenecks. GOJEK was failing, and fast.\n\nSoon, Sequoia had mutual investment portfolios and unlocked some doors. Sidu\nPonnappa, our current India Head, then the CEO of CodeMonk, travelled to\nIndonesia to pick between three of Sequoia‚Äôs companies. The team‚Äôs ultimate\ndecision to work with GOJEK is not entirely surprising because it was bigger,\nlarger than anything they had witnessed in India. The market was ripe for the\ntaking. Read his telling tale from his first visit to Indonesia here.\n[https://blog.gojekengineering.com/my-go-jek-story-af5f1925bfe]\n\nIn no time, Nadiem acquired CodeMonk. But before that, our current CTO, Niranjan\nParanjappe was being poached. ? The team stood together. It was all, or none.\n\nAnd Nadiem wanted all. The deal was closed in a small tea shop between Sidu,\nNiranjan, Nadiem, Ajey and Kevin. Overnight, GOJEK had one of India‚Äôs best\nconsulting firms in its arsenal. The task for the engineering team: Work on the\nbidding engine. No more downtimes.\n\nIt‚Äôs the 0‚Äôs and 1‚Äôs\nThe old codebase was written in Java. It‚Äôs a programming language that belonged\nto the Internet age. But not for a startup in 2015 that was exploding in demand\nand imploding with a lack of resources and engineering wherewithal. Why Java?\nBecause, the classic Golden Hammer Anti-Pattern:\n\n‚ÄúIf all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.‚Äù And hence, ‚ÄòI know\nJava, so Java is the best.‚Äô\n\nNiranjan Paranjape\n[https://medium.com/u/689ebe477c46?source=post_page-----978af9ccfd32----------------------]\n, our now CTO (Ajey Gore\n[https://medium.com/u/bb9ef62c7bae?source=post_page-----978af9ccfd32----------------------] \nis our Group CTO), plugged in the hard drive and checked the code. As soon as he\nopened the README file, the first line was mvn install -DskipTest\n\nThe code had *never* been tested.\n\nIn other words, the code was live without ever passing a single quality check.\nThe old codebase was called Stan Marsh\n[https://blog.gojekengineering.com/thank-you-stan-marsh-29db553544bf]. For the\nuninitiated, Stan Marsh is a character from South Park, and if you watch the\nshow, you‚Äôd get the obvious reference to the famous line:\n\n> ‚ÄúDude, this is pretty f****d up right here.‚Äù\nAnd thus it came to be. Stan Marsh was the legacy code on which GOJEK was going\nto be built. Because there was no test harness, it was difficult to understand\nwhich portion of the app was working, and which wasn‚Äôt. Considering the app was\nlive, no one wanted to touch a ticking time bomb. It was‚Ä¶ sorry, is‚Ä¶ very much\npart of engineering folklore. (More on that later)\n\nAs urban legends go, Niranjan re-wrote the entire codebase in Golang, a language\nhe didn‚Äôt know. Three nights. A dozen Redbulls. Two dozen coffees. Golang could\nhandle concurrency, manage load; the kind GOJEK was witnessing. The mothership\nwas ready. Or so the team thought.\n\nIt wasn‚Äôt an easy decision to go with Golang. Not many knew the programming\nlanguage. But some risks are worth taking ‚Äî and that defines good engineering\nfrom great. Luckily, this initial decision-making set the tone for the team;\nlearn, experiment, adapt, take responsibility or be disrupted. In a month,\nGOJEK‚Äôs driver count tripled. But‚Ä¶ there were more problems to come. Bigger fish\nto fry.\n\nFor Part 2 of the story, please click here\n[https://blog.gojekengineering.com/how-go-jek-manages-1-million-drivers-with-12-engineers-part-2-35f6a27a0faf]\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nStory credits: Shobhit Srivastava\n[https://medium.com/u/e5f92a17704d?source=post_page-----978af9ccfd32----------------------]\n, Ranjeet Singh\n[https://medium.com/u/710d3b419a5a?source=post_page-----978af9ccfd32----------------------]\n, Mehakdeep Singh\n[https://medium.com/u/36ce12a82c52?source=post_page-----978af9ccfd32----------------------]\n, Bergas Bimo Branarto\n[https://medium.com/u/5cffcceadf08?source=post_page-----978af9ccfd32----------------------]","html":"<p>By Adithya Venkatesan</p><p>In Norse mythology, <em><em>Yggdrasil</em></em> is a gigantic mythical tree that connects the nine worlds of Norse cosmology.

This was the birth of the ‚Äò<strong><strong>bid engine‚Äô ‚Äî a classic matchmaker between supply and demand:</strong></strong> Driver and Customer. <em><em>It would form the genesis on which GOJEK was going to be built</em></em>. The problem: siloed boxes.</p><p>There were a total of three products with the same underlying infrastructure, but no interconnectedness. THAT was a problem that shouldn‚Äôt exist when success depends on deeper linkage between all teams. This problem is further pronounced when you realise all three teams were working on the same infrastructure.</p><p><em><em>Importantly, GOJEK simply wasn‚Äôt prepared to handle the kind of adoption and growth the company began to witness as soon as the app was launched.</em></em></p><p>The algorithm started to crumble. The engineering was pretty straightforward with 10‚Äì15 lines of code, and solved problems for a small set of data. As the drivers increased, downtimes became a routine affair. There were way too many bottlenecks. <strong><strong>GOJEK was failing, and fast.</strong></strong></p><p>Soon, Sequoia had mutual investment portfolios and unlocked some doors. Sidu Ponnappa, our current India Head, then the CEO of CodeMonk, travelled to Indonesia to pick between three of Sequoia‚Äôs companies. The team‚Äôs ultimate decision to work with GOJEK is not entirely surprising because it was bigger, larger than anything they had witnessed in India. The market was ripe for the taking. Read his telling tale from his first visit to Indonesia <a href=\"https://blog.gojekengineering.com/my-go-jek-story-af5f1925bfe\" rel=\"noopener\">here.</a></p><p><em><em>In no time, Nadiem acquired CodeMonk. But before that, our current CTO, Niranjan Paranjappe was being poached. <em>? </em>The team stood together. It was all, or none.</em></em></p><p>And Nadiem wanted all. <strong><strong>The deal was closed in a small tea shop</strong></strong> between Sidu, Niranjan, Nadiem, Ajey and Kevin. Overnight, GOJEK had one of India‚Äôs best consulting firms in its arsenal. The task for the engineering team: Work on the bidding engine. No more downtimes.</p><h2 id=\"it-s-the-0-s-and-1-s\">It‚Äôs the 0‚Äôs and 1‚Äôs</h2><p>The old codebase was written in Java. It‚Äôs a programming language that belonged to the Internet age. But not for a startup in 2015 that was exploding in demand and imploding with a lack of resources and engineering wherewithal. Why Java? Because, the classic <strong><strong>Golden Hammer Anti-Pattern:</strong></strong></p><p><em><em>‚ÄúIf all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.‚Äù And hence, ‚ÄòI know Java, so Java is the best.‚Äô</em></em></p><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/u/689ebe477c46?source=post_page-----978af9ccfd32----------------------\" rel=\"noopener\">Niranjan Paranjape</a>, our now CTO (<a href=\"https://medium.com/u/bb9ef62c7bae?source=post_page-----978af9ccfd32----------------------\" rel=\"noopener\">Ajey Gore</a> is our Group CTO), plugged in the hard drive and checked the code. As soon as he opened the README file, the first line was mvn install -DskipTest</p><p><strong><strong>The code had *<em><em>never</em></em>* been tested.</strong></strong></p><p>In other words, the code was live without ever passing a single quality check. The old codebase was called <a href=\"https://blog.gojekengineering.com/thank-you-stan-marsh-29db553544bf\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong><strong>Stan Marsh</strong></strong></a><strong><strong>.</strong></strong> For the uninitiated, Stan Marsh is a character from South Park, and if you watch the show, you‚Äôd get the obvious reference to the famous line:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1600/1*Mk4tc6cfIHlC_f1CblNGNQ.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><blockquote><em><em>‚ÄúDude, this is pretty f****d up right here.‚Äù</em></em></blockquote><p>And thus it came to be. <strong><strong>Stan Marsh was the legacy code on which GOJEK was going to be built</strong></strong>. Because there was no test harness, it was difficult to understand which portion of the app was working, and which wasn‚Äôt. Considering the app was live, no one wanted to touch a ticking time bomb. It was‚Ä¶ sorry, is‚Ä¶ very much part of engineering folklore. (More on that later)</p><p>As urban legends go, Niranjan re-wrote the entire codebase in Golang, a language he didn‚Äôt know. Three nights. A dozen Redbulls. Two dozen coffees. Golang could handle concurrency, manage load; the kind GOJEK was witnessing. The mothership was ready. Or so the team thought.</p><p>It wasn‚Äôt an easy decision to go with Golang. Not many knew the programming language. But some risks are worth taking ‚Äî and that defines good engineering from great. Luckily, this initial decision-making set the tone for the team; learn, experiment, adapt, take responsibility or be disrupted. In a month, GOJEK‚Äôs driver count tripled. But‚Ä¶ there were more problems to come. Bigger fish to fry.</p><p>For Part 2 of the story, please click <a href=\"https://blog.gojekengineering.com/how-go-jek-manages-1-million-drivers-with-12-engineers-part-2-35f6a27a0faf\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a></p><hr><p>Story credits: <a href=\"https://medium.com/u/e5f92a17704d?source=post_page-----978af9ccfd32----------------------\" rel=\"noopener\">Shobhit Srivastava</a>, <a href=\"https://medium.com/u/710d3b419a5a?source=post_page-----978af9ccfd32----------------------\" rel=\"noopener\">Ranjeet Singh</a>, <a href=\"https://medium.com/u/36ce12a82c52?source=post_page-----978af9ccfd32----------------------\" rel=\"noopener\">Mehakdeep Singh</a>, <a href=\"https://medium.com/u/5cffcceadf08?source=post_page-----978af9ccfd32----------------------\" rel=\"noopener\">Bergas Bimo Branarto</a></p>","url":"https://gojek-ghost.zysk.in/how-gojek-manages-1-million-drivers-with-12-engineers-part-1/","canonical_url":null,"uuid":"ba3d779e-27f2-41a6-ac1d-cd753222d7dd","page":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_styles":null,"comment_id":"5eb12b71f7c7da001effcdbe","reading_time":4}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"why-we-swear-by-the-rca"}}}
