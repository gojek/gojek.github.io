But the journey doesn’t stop there. Even after\nbuilding all these convenient products, we still try and reduce frictions that\nmay be encountered even within our app — such as booking a ride or ordering\nfood.\n\nSo we thought, why don’t we integrate with Google Assistant, and let our users\ncommunicate with our products in a new way?\n\nIn this post, we explain how we integrated our food and transport products with\nthe Google Assistant.\n\nThe why\nWe’ve already addressed one part of the why — convenience. The other is user\nre-engagement. According to this survey\n[https://andrewchen.co/new-data-shows-why-losing-80-of-your-mobile-users-is-normal-and-that-the-best-apps-do-much-better/?utm_content=buffere4fa2&utm_medium=twitter.com&utm_source=social&utm_campaign=buffer] \nconducted by Silicon Valley researcher Andrew Chen 77% of users stop using an\napp three days after they install it. Within a month, that number goes up to\n90%. ?\n\nThe how\nTo help integrate Android apps with the Google Assistant, Google launched App\nActions:\n\nWhat are app actions?\nApp Actions are a new way to make your android app content available in places\nlike Google Search, Google Assistant etc. From a user’s perspective, App Actions\nbehave like shortcuts to parts of your Android app. When users invoke an App\nAction, the Assistant either launches a screen in the Android app that the user\nhas already installed or shows an embedded visual card (Android Slice) that\nusers can interact with.\n\nApp actions provide a faster way for users to access Android apps. It can be\nachieved in two ways:- either user can be directed to a specific\nactivity(screen) using a deep link or user may see relevant content on the\nAssistant itself called Slices.\n\nMore info on this can be found here: \nhttps://developers.google.com/assistant/app/overview\n\nWhat are Slices?\nSlices are super-powered app actions. They provide a way to interact with apps\nwithout moving away from Assistant by showing a small piece of UI within\nAssistant. Slices are UI templates that can display rich, dynamic, and\ninteractive content from the app in Google Assistant.\n\nSlices can help users perform tasks faster by enabling engagement outside of the\nfullscreen app experience.\n\nYou can build Slices as enhancements to App Actions.\n\nHere’s an example:\n\nWe choose to use slices to show food order status, as the order status will have\nlimited information (eg. Driver is on the way to Restaurant, with his location\non Map ) which can be easily shown in a small piece of UI segment.\n\nIn fact, this functionality was recently demoed on stage at a Google event in\nIndonesia. You can check it out below:\n\nApp Actions Demo at #Google4ID 2019How does it work?\nWhenever a user says or types something in Assistant, assistant parses the\nquery. If the query matches the built-in intent\n[https://developers.google.com/assistant/app/reference/built-in-intents] grammar\nthen Google Assistant extracts the query parameter in schema.org\n[https://schema.org/] and generates a deep link URL using the mapping we provide\nin an actions.xml file.\n\nGoogle then attaches those extracted parameters to the deep link URL and creates\na final deep link which allows a user to launch specific content or screens in\nthe app.\n\nLet’s dig a little deeper:\n\nGoogle applies Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (Natural Language\nProcessing) to understand all the sentences we type in Assistant.\n\nWhile users can type anything they want in Assistant and the system gets better\nat interpreting them over time, but there are some sentences for specific intent\nthat are fixed by Google. More info here\n[https://developers.google.com/assistant/app/reference/built-in-intents#create-taxi-reservation]\n.\n\nHow did we integrate our services with Assistant?\nThe core of integrating Gojek with Assistant involved creating actions on Google\nAssistant with actions.xml file.\n\nLet’s explore how to do this:\n\n1. Create actions.xml file in your XML folder. This contains all the actions\nwith built-in intents which define what actions our app can support in the\nAssistant. Each action contains built-in intents\n[https://developers.google.com/assistant/app/reference/built-in-intents#create-taxi-reservation] \nsupported by Google as a <intent-name> tag.\n\n2. Define a fulfilment mode for each app action — which can be deep links or\nslices. You have to pass a fulfilment mode in each action. This is compulsory.\n\n3. Pass the URL template which will allow a user to launch your app — this can\nbe the deep link to your app or URL to Slice provider.\n\n4. Define entity-set — the Gojek app is available in multiple locales, so to\nprovide locale for all the regions, we added the entity-set, which allows\nAssistant to understand more than one version of category. ex:- taxi can be\npronounced as taksi in Bahasa.\n\nSo, If you want locale for your specific parameter in deep-link URL, you can\nsimply attach an entity-set with that parameter, see how you can achieve this in\nbelow example\n\n<parameter name=”taxiReservation.category”><entity-set-reference\nentitySetId=”TransportCategoryEntitySet” /></parameter>\n\n5. Add a reference to actions.xml file using the <meta> tag in your app’s\nmanifest.xml file inside the application tag.\n\nIn order to integrate Slices:\n\n 1. Implement an Android Slice by following the steps described in the Slices\n    Getting Started guide\n    [https://developer.android.com/guide/slices/getting-started].\n 2. In the actions.xml file, in the <fulfillment> element, specify \n    fulfillmentMode=“actions.fulfillment.SLICE” to indicate that a user intent\n    can be fulfilled using a Slice in your app.\n\nA few quick notes on what we learnt\n 1. Testing this feature is pretty hard and things become weird when you have\n    multiple build types of your app. For testing, you need a build type on the\n    Play Store, (which means the package name of the testing build should match\n    the package name of the published app). You can use a plugin (developed by\n    Google) called App Actions Test Tool\n    [https://developers.google.com/assistant/app/test-tool] for testing this\n    feature.\n\n> Please make sure you are following points while testing with App Actions Test\nTool:\na) Log in to Android Studio and Google Assistant with the account which has\naccess to your published app on Play console.\nb) ApplicationId of the app should be the same as your published app.\nc) Your Gradle should be built successfully.\nd) Use App Action Tool to create and update preview and test the app actions and\nslice.\n2. If your app is used in different locales, you can create locales using \nentity-set\n[https://developers.google.com/assistant/app/action-schema#entity-set-reference] \nin the actions.xml file.\n\n3. In order to give early builds to QA or other users (if you have multiple\nbuild types in your app), you can create an internal test track on Play console\nand add relevant people to it. This allows you to share the build to production\nfor only some listed users.\n\n(See this\n[https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/3131213?hl=en] \nfor how you can create an internal test track for your app.)\n\n4. Actions.xml shouldn’t be obfuscated in release apk — it means if you are\nusing any obfuscated tools like proguard then actions.xml shouldn’t be\nobfuscated there.\n\n5. Slices can be requested before the onCreate of your application is completed.\nYou can run into issues if you are using something which is initialised in \nonCreate while creating slices.\n\n6. Don't refresh slices from onBindSlice() method, it will end up in an infinite\nloop where Google Assistant will call onBindSlice() infinitely.\n\nThat’s all from us folks. Hope this post gave you a better understanding of how\nApp Actions and Slices work with Google Assistant. Working on this feature was\nan amazing experience for us. If you use the Gojek app, make sure to give them a\ntry and let us know what you think. ?\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLiked what you read?

As we spread out from Jakarta,\nsatiating the hunger of millions of customers in most parts of Indonesia, GoFood\nas a product got increasingly complicated. Orders started to pile up, and we\nwere struggling to keep up with the skyrocketing demand. If we wanted to keep up\nwith users’ expectations, a few things needed to be done. We had to change, and\nsimultaneously up our game.\n\nIt’s a VUCA world, and we often remind ourselves that not a lot of things are\nconstant. We’ve been working hard to reimagine, re-engineer and redesign the\nGoFood flow which hasn’t been altered too much for many years.\n\nTo help you understand how it all started, let’s take you back in time a little\nbit…\n\nWhen the Gojek app for ride-hailing was launched in early 2015, we noticed there\nwere times when our driver partners had lean work periods. To provide additional\nmeans to help them make use of this time and earn more, GoSend (to send\ncouriers) and GoShop (to buy anything) were launched as auxiliary services.\n\n> We noticed that majority of orders placed in GoShop were for food. This gave way\nto GoFood, our dedicated food delivery product, launched in mid-2015.\nPhase 1: Listing Model\nGoFood started as a concierge model, where we had no tie-ups with restaurants. A\nSalesforce was deployed to list as many restaurant menus as possible on our\nplatform. When a customer placed an order, it would be assigned to one of our\ndriver partners, who would then go and place the order at the restaurant. The\ndriver partner would wait around, and when the order was ready, pay in cash,\npickup the order and deliver it to the customer.\n\nTedious? Yes. Scalable? No. 🤷‍\n\n\nPhase 2: Partnering With Merchants\nTo arrive at a scalable solution, we realised we had to take the restaurant\nmerchants along with us in this journey and welcome them into our ecosystem. We\nstarted partnering with the merchants, who were known as ‘GoFood Partners’.\n\n> This not only helped our merchants grow their businesses, but also got ample\nvisibility boost on GoFood.\nEven after onboarding them into our ecosystem, a large part of the process was\nmanual. It was far from ideal because there was no record of transactions\nbesides a booking on GoFood and a receipt handed to the driver partner.\n\nOften there were discrepancies in the number of orders assigned and the number\nof orders completed. How, you ask?\n\nImagine a GoFood partner who is part of a large chain of restaurants. When\nsomeone orders food from this chain, GoFood assigns this order to one outlet.\nHowever, the driver partner may decide to visit another outlet and pick up the\norder, as per convenience.\n\nThere were more problems galore.\n\nIf a merchant partner was not open for business on a particular day, and wanted\nto update their menu, or indicate items as out of stock, they had to call the\nGojek Customer Care. During this time, orders would still be coming in, which\nresulted in driver partners accepting orders that most certainly couldn’t be\ncompleted without a hassle.\n\nThere was a lot that needed fixing here, and it could only be done by\nintegrating merchants more deeply into our ecosystem. So, that’s exactly what we\ndid.\n\nPhase 3: The merchant app, GoResto\nTowards the end of 2016, a concept was developed for an app that would cater to\nmerchant partners, and by early 2017 GoResto (which is what we called it at the\ntime) was ready.\n\nWe introduced the following in GoResto:\n\n1. Electronic payments\nAll of Gojek’s driver partners had GoPay e-wallets associated with their\naccounts. With GoResto, we did the same for our GoFood partners. Transactions\nbetween driver and GoFood partners was directly wallet-to-wallet, hence,\ncashless.\n\n2. PIN exchange for restaurant verification\nTo ensure the order is secured, driver partners would also need to share a PIN\nwith the merchant while picking up the order. This electronic handshake helped\nus verify they were indeed picking up the right order from the right outlet.\n\n3. Catalog management\nWe noticed a lot of cancellations were happening because the items were either\nout of stock, restaurants were closed or customers were generally skeptical\nabout ordering dishes that didn’t have enough reference images. So, we started\nfocussing more on improving the product experience for our customers and BCR\n(booking completion rate). Catalog management was introduced so that the\nmerchants could regularly update details that customers saw on GoFood. For\nexample: Availability status of dishes that were put on the menu, uploading\ndetails pertaining to different items sold, etc.\n\nIn the meanwhile, GoResto was rebranded to GoBiz. What started off as a product\nthat helped merchants to manage their food orders, started evolving into\nsomething bigger. Since the scope extended beyond GoFood, calling it ‘GoResto’\nmade no sense.\n\nThe rebranding came with enhanced features in GoBiz. As you might’ve guessed, it\nalso came with new, enhanced problems and a sub-optimal flow:\n\n⚠️ The driver partner was ready, but the food wasn’t\n> The average time taken for a driver partner was:\n~9 minutes to pick up an order\n~19 minutes to deliver the order\nA portion of this time was spent by the driver waiting for the food to be\nprepared, because in most cases, GoFood partners started preparing food only\nafter the driver arrived! This was mostly because customer would add more food\nitems or the ordered items would be out of stock. We figured that the driver\narrival time could be parallelised with the food prep time. This led to 2\nimportant things:\n\n * Overall delivery time for the customer could be reduced\n * Wait time for the driver could be utilised to fulfil other orders\n\n️️️⚠️ GoFood Partner-driven cancellations existed, accountability didn’t\nGoFood partners had the ability to set their open hours and change item\navailability, but they didn’t always keep it updated. When cancellations\npertaining to these reasons happened, they were handled by…the driver partners.\n🤦‍♀️\nThis meant, the orders had to be cancelled either by the driver partners or the\ncustomers themselves.\n\n> Items being out of stock or restaurants being closed accounted for over 35% of\nall customer cancellations after a driver was assigned.\nOn the driver side, these accounted for over 75% of all driver cancellations. 😓\n⚠️ Price edits became pricey\nIn this order flow, the driver placed the final order with the merchant. This\nessentially means that the original order placed by the customer could be\nmodified due to various reasons: Incorrect listing of price, unavailability of\nitems, adding new items to the order, etc. To accommodate these cases, drivers\nwere allowed to input to final price of the order, leading to a price edit.\n\nAnd price edits aren’t uncommon. They happen to ~34% of the orders.\n\nMultiple moving pieces exposed these orders to skip payments or consumer wallet\nsweeps.\n\nPhase 4: Introducing Merchant Acceptance Flow\nDue to various reasons, our driver partners were handling GoFood partner-driven\ncancellations and heavy-lifting to ensure the orders were fulfilled. This, too,\nhad to change.\n\nAfter brainstorming, mind-mapping and head-scratching, we arrived at Merchant\nAccept Flow (MAF). The merchants who are onboarded to MAF are called Super\nPartners. The solution lets our Super Partners accept/reject orders based on the\nrestaurant being open, availability of items, or any other factors that\ndetermine order fulfilment or cancellation. This in turn helps our customers and\ndriver partners know that the merchant is preparing food for sure, so that there\nare no customer or driver cancellations.\n\nIn Part-2 of this blog, we’ll dive deep into Merchant Acceptance Flow, how we\nwent about designing it and introducing Super Partners to our customers.

As we spread out from Jakarta, satiating the hunger of millions of customers in most parts of Indonesia, GoFood as a product got increasingly complicated. Orders started to pile up, and we were struggling to keep up with the skyrocketing demand. If we wanted to keep up with users’ expectations, a few things needed to be done. We had to change, and simultaneously up our game.</p><p>It’s a VUCA world, and we often remind ourselves that not a lot of things are constant. We’ve been working hard to reimagine, re-engineer and redesign the GoFood flow which hasn’t been altered too much for many years.</p><p>To help you understand how it all started, let’s take you back in time a little bit…</p><p>When the Gojek app for ride-hailing was launched in early 2015, we noticed there were times when our driver partners had lean work periods. To provide additional means to help them make use of this time and earn more, GoSend (to send couriers) and GoShop (to buy anything) were launched as auxiliary services.</p><blockquote>We noticed that majority of orders placed in GoShop were for food. This gave way to GoFood, our dedicated food delivery product, launched in mid-2015.</blockquote><h3 id=\"phase-1-listing-model\">Phase 1: Listing Model</h3><p>GoFood started as a concierge model, where we had no tie-ups with restaurants. A Salesforce was deployed to list as many restaurant menus as possible on our platform. When a customer placed an order, it would be assigned to one of our driver partners, who would then go and place the order at the restaurant. The driver partner would wait around, and when the order was ready, pay in cash, pickup the order and deliver it to the customer.</p><h3 id=\"tedious-yes-scalable-no-\"><em>Tedious? Yes. Scalable? No. 🤷‍</em></h3><p></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://gojek-ghost.zysk.in/content/images/2020/06/image-16.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><h3 id=\"phase-2-partnering-with-merchants\">Phase 2: Partnering With Merchants</h3><p>To arrive at a scalable solution, we realised we had to take the restaurant merchants along with us in this journey and welcome them into our ecosystem. We started partnering with the merchants, who were known as ‘<strong><em>GoFood Partners</em></strong>’.</p><blockquote>This not only helped our merchants grow their businesses, but also got ample visibility boost on GoFood.</blockquote><p>Even after onboarding them into our ecosystem, a large part of the process was manual. It was far from ideal because there was no record of transactions besides a booking on GoFood and a receipt handed to the driver partner.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://gojek-ghost.zysk.in/content/images/2020/06/image-17.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>Often there were discrepancies in the number of orders assigned and the number of orders completed. How, you ask?</p><p>Imagine a GoFood partner who is part of a large chain of restaurants. When someone orders food from this chain, GoFood assigns this order to one outlet. However, the driver partner may decide to visit another outlet and pick up the order, as per convenience.</p><h3 id=\"there-were-more-problems-galore-\"><em>There were more problems galore.</em><br></h3><p>If a merchant partner was not open for business on a particular day, and wanted to update their menu, or indicate items as out of stock, they had to call the Gojek Customer Care. During this time, orders would still be coming in, which resulted in driver partners accepting orders that most certainly couldn’t be completed without a hassle.</p><p>There was a lot that needed fixing here, and it could only be done by integrating merchants more deeply into our ecosystem. So, that’s exactly what we did.</p><h3 id=\"phase-3-the-merchant-app-goresto\">Phase 3: The merchant app, GoResto</h3><p>Towards the end of 2016, a concept was developed for an app that would cater to merchant partners, and by early 2017 GoResto (which is what we called it at the time) was ready.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://gojek-ghost.zysk.in/content/images/2020/06/image-18.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>We introduced the following in GoResto:</p><h4 id=\"1-electronic-payments\">1. Electronic payments</h4><p>All of Gojek’s driver partners had GoPay e-wallets associated with their accounts. With GoResto, we did the same for our GoFood partners. Transactions between driver and GoFood partners was directly wallet-to-wallet, hence, cashless.</p><h4 id=\"2-pin-exchange-for-restaurant-verification\">2. PIN exchange for restaurant verification</h4><p>To ensure the order is secured, driver partners would also need to share a PIN with the merchant while picking up the order. This electronic handshake helped us verify they were indeed picking up the right order from the right outlet.</p><h4 id=\"3-catalog-management\">3. Catalog management</h4><p>We noticed a lot of cancellations were happening because the items were either out of stock, restaurants were closed or customers were generally skeptical about ordering dishes that didn’t have enough reference images.

That’s why we went on the journey to build GoModal.</p><p>So people like Amalia never have to worry about buying strawberries again.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://gojek-ghost.zysk.in/content/images/2020/06/image-15.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>Want more of content like this? <a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/go-jek/gojek-tech-newsletter\" rel=\"noopener\">Sign up for our newsletter</a>!</p>","url":"https://gojek-ghost.zysk.in/helping-our-helpers-with-gomodal/","canonical_url":null,"uuid":"c9b06805-5e63-4c53-acc9-6fe01ed0a349","page":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_styles":null,"comment_id":"5ed9f3e47aa22c4066f8405b","reading_time":4}},{"node":{"id":"Ghost__Post__5ed9e2717aa22c4066f83fe8","title":"The Process Behind Program Management","slug":"the-process-behind-program-management","featured":false,"feature_image":"https://gojek-ghost.zysk.in/content/images/2020/06/ProcessProgramManagement.jpg","excerpt":"Using a Program Management and Agile approach to make deliverables skyrocket.","custom_excerpt":"Using a Program Management and Agile approach to make deliverables skyrocket.","visibility":"public","created_at_pretty":"05 June, 2020","published_at_pretty":"05 June, 2020","updated_at_pretty":"05 June, 2020","created_at":"2020-06-05T11:43:05.000+05:30","published_at":"2020-06-05T12:06:33.000+05:30","updated_at":"2020-06-05T13:07:06.000+05:30","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"og_description":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"authors":[{"name":"Gojek","slug":"gojek","bio":"Gojek is a Super App. It’s one app for ordering food, commuting, digital payments, shopping, hyper-local delivery, and two dozen services.","profile_image":"https://gojek-ghost.zysk.in/content/images/2020/05/logo-01-1.png","twitter":"@gojektech","facebook":"gojektech","website":"https://www.gojek.io"}],"primary_author":{"name":"Gojek","slug":"gojek","bio":"Gojek is a Super App. It’s one app for ordering food, commuting, digital payments, shopping, hyper-local delivery, and two dozen services.","profile_image":"https://gojek-ghost.zysk.in/content/images/2020/05/logo-01-1.png","twitter":"@gojektech","facebook":"gojektech","website":"https://www.gojek.io"},"primary_tag":{"name":"Tech","slug":"tech","description":"Learnings from technical challenges solved at Gojek, how-tos, and programming tips.","feature_image":null,"meta_description":null,"meta_title":null,"visibility":"public"},"tags":[{"name":"Tech","slug":"tech","description":"Learnings from technical challenges solved at Gojek, how-tos, and programming tips.","feature_image":null,"meta_description":null,"meta_title":null,"visibility":"public"},{"name":"Gojek","slug":"gojek","description":null,"feature_image":null,"meta_description":null,"meta_title":null,"visibility":"public"},{"name":"Program Management","slug":"program-management","description":null,"feature_image":null,"meta_description":null,"meta_title":null,"visibility":"public"},{"name":"Project Management","slug":"project-management","description":null,"feature_image":null,"meta_description":null,"meta_title":null,"visibility":"public"},{"name":"Scrum","slug":"scrum","description":null,"feature_image":null,"meta_description":null,"meta_title":null,"visibility":"public"}],"plaintext":"We’ve often talked about how Gojek doesn’t build one Super App, it builds three.\nTo achieve this, multiple Product Development Groups (PDG) exist within Gojek.\nOne of these is the GoMerchants PDG, that handles all our merchant-centric\ninitiatives, including GoBiz, our SuperApp for merchant partners.\n\nGoMerchants is an entity formed by the fusion of multiple teams that all had\ntheir own work styles. How do such diverse people come together and build\namazing things? That’s where Program Management comes into the picture.\n\nThe Challenge\nGoMerchants PDG was formed from five separate teams (SPOTS, Midtrans, Mapan,\nGoResto, Nadipos), and each team had a unique engineering culture. Across teams,\nthe total number of staff involved in cross-functional work was ~240 people.\n\nAfter a discovery phase of the process over 3 months with the various groups, we\nfound that every team was utilising different versions of project management\nmethodology and tools to track team progress. Across various teams, we\nidentified nearly a dozen different types of tools and methods including the\nScrum method, Kanban method, Jira tools, Favro Tools, and Trello tools.\n\nThe key takeaway was clear: There was no single source of truth for tracking\nteam deployment progress.\n\nThe Solution\nTo achieve our goal of reaching a high rate of (quality) deliverables with clear\ntransparency on progress, the Program Managers decided to build a program that\nset a single standard workflow for everyone involved. The end result? A meld of\nAgile best practices and a limited/select set of tools.\n\nAt the highest level, Program Management methodology focuses on adding just \nenough processes to help with efficiency — and not creating convoluted processes\nfor the sake of process. Keeping these best practices in mind, the workflow\nbuilt by the GoMerchants Program Management team entailed Scrum Process to track\nbacklog priority, using Confluence as a documentation hub, Jira for managing\nbacklog tasks, Pre-Iteration Planning Meetings, Sprint Planning, Daily Standups,\nand lastly, conducting regular Retrospectives.\n\nThe consolidated approach helped the GoMerchants team reach the rapid pace\nneeded to hit targeting of deliverables— but also helped support the team in an\nenvironment of rapidly-changing requirements via greater transparency.\n\nThere were additional benefits to this approach, as well: Instantaneous feedback\nfrom the team on what was working (and what was not), metrics to inform future\niterations of the workflow, and a reduction in deployment failure — and rollback\ndeployment risk — thanks to rapid and continuous internal communication.\n\n> “Agile software development is an approach to software development under which\nrequirements and solutions evolve through the collaborative effort of\nself-organizing and cross-functional teams and their customer(s)/end user(s).” —\nCollier, Ken W. (2011). Agile Analytics: A Value-Driven Approach to Business\nIntelligence and Data Warehousing. Pearson Education.\nTo transform quality deployment with high pace targets, the program implemented\nfar better collaboration for a large team than previously existed.\n\nAt the same time, Jira was chosen as the one crucial tool for backlog management\nfor GoMerchants. The factors in selecting Jira were the platform functionality\nis highly-configurable to the specific requirements of a team, as well, as it\nhas the flexibility to allow for usage in a wide variety of environments and\nprocesses.\n\nScrum Activities\nBelow is the flow of scrum activity. It starts from Pre-Iteration Planning\nMeeting (Pre-IPM), Retrospective, IPM/Sprint Planning, and Daily Standup:\n\nSprints\nA Sprint is a time-box of iterations, where the releasable works that align with\nsprint goals are implemented. A Sprint always has a fixed start and end date —\nthese dates should be of the same duration; typically two weeks.\n\nSource: Essential Scrum: A Practical Guide to the Most Popular Agile Process\nSprints notes: While most of GoMerchants PDG uses two-week sprints, the length\nof time can depend on several factors like the final deadline, number of people\nin the team, and holidays in the calendar. Some teams use a one-week Sprint\ncycle due to urgent work that requires moving at an accelerated pace. But,\ngenerally it is not a best practice to use one-week sprint cycles as team\nachievement moments can be missed, quality could be sacrificed, and team\nburn-out is a real risk.\n\nPre-I.P.M. (Pre-Iteration Planning Meeting)\nPre-IPM is an activity to review the active Sprint and manage backlog and Sprint\ngoal(s) for the next iteration. Pre-IPM is attended by a Product Manager, Tech\nLeads, and Program Manager. The Product Manager should write-up the ‘story’ aka\nplan, in Jira after Pre-IPM. Tech lead should advise if the story and goals for\nthe next iteration are technically achievable.\n\nAs a Program Manager, you can use spreadsheets for mapping between the story and\nteam before doing the IPM. Below is the example:\n\nPre-IPM notes: This is basically a small meeting with a PM, TechLead, HoE/HoP\n(if necessary) and PgM. The purpose is to finalise the work backlog for the team\nin the upcoming Sprint. This meeting will help streamline the Sprint Planning\nmeeting by confirming that the final requirements have been aligned by all\nstakeholders — the goal being to reduce the number of “Requirement Changes”\ngoing forward. .\n\nRetrospective\nThe purpose of a retrospective in IPM is to collect previous sprint feedback\nfrom the team. It contains some columns like:\n\n * Glad: What makes you happy in this sprint or things that went well\n * Sad: What makes you sad in this sprint and from here we can see how we can\n   improve it\n * Mad: What makes you mad or frustrated in this sprint\n * Ideas: Idea to improve our next sprint\n * Appreciation: Appreciation in this sprint, esp if there’s a pretty big team\n   achievement\n * Action Item: Action item to improve our next sprint based on Sad, Mad, and\n   Ideas columns. This is the important part to be followed up so “lesson\n   learned” value from every sprint is really working\n\nWe can use several tools to help us collect data, i.e. https://funretro.io/,\nbelow is the example:\n\nSend a retrospective link to a Slack channel before IPM and encourage the team\nto fill the cards. Do the retrospective by talking through each column 15–30\nminutes before IPM starts.\n\nRetrospective notes: This session provides the opportunity for a team to look\nback and see how they can improve. Retrospectives can be a catalyst for\norganisational change, team change or even a culture change. The Retrospective\ncan be a place to build and enable teams, or to help teams start their journey\nwith a clear understanding of where to go next. It’s a method that is very\nuseful to gauge the Team Happiness state and gain Improvement Feedback from the\nteam. A Retrospective also builds trust and helps make the team grow stronger as\nindividual members know they have an outlet to express their feedback and they\nwill be heard by their managers and colleagues. Since this process is highly\nactionable, the PgM’s have incorporated it beyond the use case of small teams,\nand have instituted it at larger scale for the entire GoMerchants PDG Org every\n6 months.\n\nIPM/Sprint Planning\nIPM/Sprint Planning is an activity that is attended by all members of the team\nto prioritise the backlog, discuss stories, and determine story points.\n\nSource: http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1928232Below are the\nsteps taken in an IPM:\n\nBefore IPM:\n\n * Program Manager sends a retrospective link to a Slack channel\n\nDuring IPM:\n\n * Retrospective 15 min\n * Open Sprint Report to review active sprint (Done and Not Done)\n * Complete Sprint\n * Open velocity chart to review the commitment and complete stories from the\n   previous Sprint\n * Ask the team who will take a leave and discuss with PM about achievement\n   story (this will be helpful to adjust velocity for the next Sprint)\n * The PM explains each story for a new sprint. Make sure there’s always a DoD\n   and add story points\n * Add the Sprint Goal\n * Start Sprint\n * After IPM\n * Collect result of retrospective, make sure action items are done/started to\n   be worked on\n\nDaily Standup\nStand up Preparation:\n\n * Set a daily schedule (max 15 mins) and make sure the team is committed to\n   attend stand up\n * Remind the team to update Jira 10–30 mins before stand up\n\nDuring Stand up\n\n * Open Jira dashboard to review story update and movement.\n * Create a set of Standup Notes and copy it in the team Slack channel if\n   necessary\n * Ask these questions and record the answer to each member: What did I\n   accomplish since the last daily standup? What obstacles are impeding my\n   progress? What will I do by the next daily standup?\n * Daily Stand up notes: There are times people will forget to update Jira\n   ticket (it’s a never-ending challenge 💁). As a Program Manager, we need to\n   remind/ensure their team updates Jira (at least) right beforethe stand up\n   starts.\n\nThe Results\nWe’ll let them speak for themselves!\n\nH1 & H2 2019 resultAfter building a standard approach across teams using Agile,\nJira, and other tool sets, the Program Management approach used by the\nGoMerchants PgM team to combine these elements helped to vastly improve the\neffectiveness of team performance on 2019 period.

A large part\nof this is driven by GoFood, the largest food delivery service in Indonesia, as\nwell as the expansion of GoPay into other sectors both within and outside the\nGojek ecosystem.\n\nGojek Co-CEO, Andre Soelistyo, said:\n\n> This is great validation that the world’s most innovative tech companies\nrecognise the positive impact Gojek is making in Indonesia and the whole of\nSoutheast Asia. By working together, we have the opportunity to achieve\nsomething truly unique as we aim to help more businesses to digitise and ensure\nthat many millions more consumers are enjoying the benefits that the digital\neconomy can bring.\n> The COVID-19 pandemic and its associated issues have served as a tough reminder\nthat if our economies are to be more resilient, they must be underpinned by\ndigital infrastructure that diversifies the ways in which people can live and\ntransact. We see our role as a convener of global tech expertise, facilitating\ncollaboration that will ultimately lead to a better future for everyone in our\nregion.\nGojek Co-CEO, Kevin Aluwi, added:\n\n> Since we were founded, the story of Gojek’s growth has been inexorably linked\nwith the growth of the micro-entrepreneurs and small businesses on our platform\nand this will always be the case. With some of the world’s best technology\ncompanies as partners, we are confident that we can continue to deliver unique\nworld-class products and services for the various players in our ecosystem.\nFacebook’s investment is the first it has made in an Indonesia-based business as\nit seeks to create new opportunities for businesses in the country, including\nthrough its ubiquitous Whatsapp service.\n\nMatt Idema, Chief Operating Officer at WhatsApp, said: “Gojek, WhatsApp and\nFacebook are indispensable services in Indonesia. Working together we can help\nbring millions of small businesses and the customers they serve into the largest\ndigital economy in Southeast Asia.”\n\nAs part of its commercial agreement, PayPal’s payment capabilities will be\nintegrated into Gojek’s services and the two companies will also collaborate to\nallow customers of GoPay, Gojek’s digital wallet, to gain access to PayPal’s\nnetwork of more than 25 million merchants around the world.\n\nFarhad Maleki, Head of Corporate Development and Ventures for APAC at PayPal,\nsaid: “Southeast Asia is at an inflection point in digital adoption that creates\nnew opportunities to deliver financial services to previously unbanked merchants\nand consumers. We could not be more excited about entering into this strategic\nrelationship with Gojek to expand access and provide new experiences for our\ncollective customers in this dynamic market and around the world.”\n\nGoogle and Tencent are longstanding investors in Gojek. Both companies have\ncollaborated on multiple Gojek projects since their first investments in 2018.\n\nCaesar Sengupta, VP, Payments and Next Billion Users, Google, said: “Gojek’s\ninnovation and technologies have had an incredible impact in making life more\nconvenient for Indonesians across the country and in bringing its MSMEs online.\nWe’re pleased to continue to invest in and enable Gojek in its journey. Gojek’s\nsuccess points to the strength of the region’s internet economy and the\ninnovation in its start-up ecosystem.”\n\nJeffrey Li, Vice President of Tencent Holdings and Managing Partner of Tencent\nInvestment, said, “Gojek is effectively promoting digitization and financially\nenabling small businesses.

While it is extremely rewarding, it is also\nchallenging. This is because we often work on tough problems with no clear\nsolution — which involves taking risks and learning things on the fly.\n\nAll this, while competing with the best in the industry.\n\nThat’s why our guiding principles serve as a great reference point to deal with\nsituations that arise every day. Here are some that we abide by:\n\nEveryone writes code — At Gojek, we believe that Software\nPrincipals/Architects/Engineers can only do the right thing when they work on\ncode themselves. It’s the only way to decide what’s working and what’s not. We\ndon’t believe that software requires a 50,000 foot overview with people\nexclusively working on the blueprint. At Gojek, writing software is not a\nlow-level task; it’s at the very core of what we do.\n\nLeaders who code are better judges of technical skill.\n\nEveryone needs to ‘walk the talk’ — We respect people who get down in the\ntrenches and take a hands-on approach to problem solving. Based on our\nexperience, standing at a distance and issuing commandments has many a time been\ninefficient and error prone, and hence we avoid this.\n\nLeaders are grown and not made — We believe in acquired respect and leadership,\nnot leadership by position. At Gojek, you earn your leadership mettle. We\nbelieve in helping our people grow into leadership roles by giving them chances,\nrisk appetite and freedom. We trust our people and support them to do the right\nthing at any given moment. In my own career, I’ve been privileged enough to have\nfound some amazing mentors, and I am glad to be able to continue the legacy at\nGojek.\n\nEvery decision is correct at the time it is made — Swift decision-making is\nextremely important in a fast paced environment like ours. Once a decision is\nmade, we don’t constantly agonise over it or second guess. We trust that\nwhenever someone makes a decision, it is the right one, given the information\navailable to them at that time. Only the passage of time can tell us whether a\nparticular decision was right or wrong. It’s OK to change decisions, and we\nencourage people to not be afraid to make a decision.\n\nEvery person has some strengths, even if we don’t always see them — A great team\nis built with a group of people who have complementary skill sets. A combination\nof different strengths make teams that can tackle all kinds of situations. At\nGojek, we believe each one of us is unique and has unique strengths. It’s just a\nmatter of finding the right role to match the skills. Teams become super strong\nwhen they appreciate each other’s strengths.\n\nWorking in tech means learning all the time — Learning is important in every\nfield. In the technology industry, it is a matter of life and death. Technology\nis changing all the time, what worked a decade ago may be completely obsolete\nnow. For example, practices that worked in Waterfall don’t work in Agile, and\nuser experiences on mobile apps were unimaginable a few years back. So, we\nconstantly look for and admire people who are curious and willing to learn.\n\nThe best part? Such people will always hire people they can learn from!\n\nPair Programming and Test-Driven Development (TDD) work — If they didn’t, our\nteams wouldn’t exist. Wherever we have followed this, we found our team’s job on\nsupporting software is more around features than bugs!

It’s a holy tree whose branches touch the heavens.\nThe gods hold court beneath Yggdrasil — debating the fates of other gods, men\nand monsters. It’s the tree of life and the centre of everything in Norse\nmythology. In GOJEK, think of the `Allocations` team as this eternal green ash\ntree. Our multiple products rely on this team to assign drivers to complete\norders.\n\nThe team cuts across products and services responsible for 1,000,000+ registered\ndrivers on our platform.\n\nAnd 12 engineers do this.\n\nA similar ride-sharing equivalent has 300-odd people solving the same problem\nand still does fewer bookings. But how do they do it? This is their story.\n\nOn planet Earth, problems galore\nWhen GOJEK started in 2010, it all began with a call centre. Customers would\ncall a number, the call centre would ‘allocate’ a driver after looking at an\nExcel sheet of drivers in the roster. Our CEO Nadiem Makarim was the first\nperson to test the app built for drivers and customers. As soon as a dummy order\nwas created and Nadiem got the first notification, GOJEK was open for business.\n\nAt its peak in 2014, GOJEK had 200 drivers. The 3-person engineering team had a\nbasic stop-gap model of matchmaking between a driver and a customer. This\ncodebase had to be reworked to match scale. The new matchmaking codebase was\nbuilt in two days and could handle about 700 drivers. It was all manual and\nsomething had to be done to automate\n[https://blog.gojekengineering.com/how-we-do-what-we-do-at-go-jek-tech-d1d5d952e13] \nthe whole process.\n\nIn the beginning of 2015, a version of the app was launched to keep pace with\nincreasing demand. GO-RIDE, GO-FOOD and GO-SEND went live. Customers would ‘bid’\nfor a driver, drivers would get a notification, accept a drive and voila, we’re\ngood to go. This was the birth of the ‘bid engine’ — a classic matchmaker\nbetween supply and demand: Driver and Customer. It would form the genesis on\nwhich GOJEK was going to be built. The problem: siloed boxes.\n\nThere were a total of three products with the same underlying infrastructure,\nbut no interconnectedness. THAT was a problem that shouldn’t exist when success\ndepends on deeper linkage between all teams. This problem is further pronounced\nwhen you realise all three teams were working on the same infrastructure.\n\nImportantly, GOJEK simply wasn’t prepared to handle the kind of adoption and\ngrowth the company began to witness as soon as the app was launched.\n\nThe algorithm started to crumble. The engineering was pretty straightforward\nwith 10–15 lines of code, and solved problems for a small set of data. As the\ndrivers increased, downtimes became a routine affair. There were way too many\nbottlenecks. GOJEK was failing, and fast.\n\nSoon, Sequoia had mutual investment portfolios and unlocked some doors. Sidu\nPonnappa, our current India Head, then the CEO of CodeMonk, travelled to\nIndonesia to pick between three of Sequoia’s companies. The team’s ultimate\ndecision to work with GOJEK is not entirely surprising because it was bigger,\nlarger than anything they had witnessed in India. The market was ripe for the\ntaking. Read his telling tale from his first visit to Indonesia here.\n[https://blog.gojekengineering.com/my-go-jek-story-af5f1925bfe]\n\nIn no time, Nadiem acquired CodeMonk. But before that, our current CTO, Niranjan\nParanjappe was being poached. ? The team stood together. It was all, or none.\n\nAnd Nadiem wanted all. The deal was closed in a small tea shop between Sidu,\nNiranjan, Nadiem, Ajey and Kevin. Overnight, GOJEK had one of India’s best\nconsulting firms in its arsenal. The task for the engineering team: Work on the\nbidding engine. No more downtimes.\n\nIt’s the 0’s and 1’s\nThe old codebase was written in Java. It’s a programming language that belonged\nto the Internet age. But not for a startup in 2015 that was exploding in demand\nand imploding with a lack of resources and engineering wherewithal. Why Java?\nBecause, the classic Golden Hammer Anti-Pattern:\n\n“If all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.” And hence, ‘I know\nJava, so Java is the best.’\n\nNiranjan Paranjape\n[https://medium.com/u/689ebe477c46?source=post_page-----978af9ccfd32----------------------]\n, our now CTO (Ajey Gore\n[https://medium.com/u/bb9ef62c7bae?source=post_page-----978af9ccfd32----------------------] \nis our Group CTO), plugged in the hard drive and checked the code. As soon as he\nopened the README file, the first line was mvn install -DskipTest\n\nThe code had *never* been tested.\n\nIn other words, the code was live without ever passing a single quality check.\nThe old codebase was called Stan Marsh\n[https://blog.gojekengineering.com/thank-you-stan-marsh-29db553544bf]. For the\nuninitiated, Stan Marsh is a character from South Park, and if you watch the\nshow, you’d get the obvious reference to the famous line:\n\n> “Dude, this is pretty f****d up right here.”\nAnd thus it came to be. Stan Marsh was the legacy code on which GOJEK was going\nto be built. Because there was no test harness, it was difficult to understand\nwhich portion of the app was working, and which wasn’t. Considering the app was\nlive, no one wanted to touch a ticking time bomb. It was… sorry, is… very much\npart of engineering folklore. (More on that later)\n\nAs urban legends go, Niranjan re-wrote the entire codebase in Golang, a language\nhe didn’t know. Three nights. A dozen Redbulls. Two dozen coffees.

It’s a holy tree whose branches touch the heavens. The gods hold court beneath <em><em>Yggdrasil — </em></em>debating the fates of other gods, men and monsters. It’s the tree of life and the centre of everything in Norse mythology. In GOJEK, think of the <strong><strong><em><em>`Allocations` </em></em></strong></strong>team as this eternal green ash tree. Our multiple products rely on this team to assign drivers to complete orders.</p><p>The team cuts across products and services responsible for 1,000,000+ registered drivers on our platform.</p><p><strong>And 12 engineers do this.</strong></p><p>A similar ride-sharing equivalent has 300-odd people solving the same problem and still does fewer bookings. But how do they do it? This is their story.</p><h2 id=\"on-planet-earth-problems-galore\">On planet Earth, problems galore</h2><p>When GOJEK started in 2010, it all began with a call centre. Customers would call a number, the call centre would ‘allocate’ a driver after <em><em>looking at an Excel sheet of drivers</em></em> in the roster. Our CEO Nadiem Makarim was the first person to test the app built for drivers and customers. As soon as a dummy order was created and Nadiem got the first notification, GOJEK was open for business.</p><p>At its peak in 2014, GOJEK had 200 drivers. The 3-person engineering team had a basic stop-gap model of matchmaking between a driver and a customer. This codebase had to be reworked to match scale. The new matchmaking codebase was built in two days and could handle about 700 drivers. It was all manual and something had to be done to <a href=\"https://blog.gojekengineering.com/how-we-do-what-we-do-at-go-jek-tech-d1d5d952e13\" rel=\"noopener\">automate</a> the whole process.</p><p>In the beginning of 2015, a version of the app was launched to keep pace with increasing demand. GO-RIDE, GO-FOOD and GO-SEND went live. Customers would ‘bid’ for a driver, drivers would get a notification, accept a drive and voila, we’re good to go. This was the birth of the ‘<strong><strong>bid engine’ — a classic matchmaker between supply and demand:</strong></strong> Driver and Customer. <em><em>It would form the genesis on which GOJEK was going to be built</em></em>. The problem: siloed boxes.</p><p>There were a total of three products with the same underlying infrastructure, but no interconnectedness. THAT was a problem that shouldn’t exist when success depends on deeper linkage between all teams. This problem is further pronounced when you realise all three teams were working on the same infrastructure.</p><p><em><em>Importantly, GOJEK simply wasn’t prepared to handle the kind of adoption and growth the company began to witness as soon as the app was launched.</em></em></p><p>The algorithm started to crumble. The engineering was pretty straightforward with 10–15 lines of code, and solved problems for a small set of data. As the drivers increased, downtimes became a routine affair. There were way too many bottlenecks. <strong><strong>GOJEK was failing, and fast.</strong></strong></p><p>Soon, Sequoia had mutual investment portfolios and unlocked some doors. Sidu Ponnappa, our current India Head, then the CEO of CodeMonk, travelled to Indonesia to pick between three of Sequoia’s companies. The team’s ultimate decision to work with GOJEK is not entirely surprising because it was bigger, larger than anything they had witnessed in India. The market was ripe for the taking. Read his telling tale from his first visit to Indonesia <a href=\"https://blog.gojekengineering.com/my-go-jek-story-af5f1925bfe\" rel=\"noopener\">here.</a></p><p><em><em>In no time, Nadiem acquired CodeMonk. But before that, our current CTO, Niranjan Paranjappe was being poached. <em>? </em>The team stood together. It was all, or none.</em></em></p><p>And Nadiem wanted all. <strong><strong>The deal was closed in a small tea shop</strong></strong> between Sidu, Niranjan, Nadiem, Ajey and Kevin. Overnight, GOJEK had one of India’s best consulting firms in its arsenal. The task for the engineering team: Work on the bidding engine. No more downtimes.</p><h2 id=\"it-s-the-0-s-and-1-s\">It’s the 0’s and 1’s</h2><p>The old codebase was written in Java. It’s a programming language that belonged to the Internet age. But not for a startup in 2015 that was exploding in demand and imploding with a lack of resources and engineering wherewithal. Why Java? Because, the classic <strong><strong>Golden Hammer Anti-Pattern:</strong></strong></p><p><em><em>“If all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.” And hence, ‘I know Java, so Java is the best.’</em></em></p><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/u/689ebe477c46?source=post_page-----978af9ccfd32----------------------\" rel=\"noopener\">Niranjan Paranjape</a>, our now CTO (<a href=\"https://medium.com/u/bb9ef62c7bae?source=post_page-----978af9ccfd32----------------------\" rel=\"noopener\">Ajey Gore</a> is our Group CTO), plugged in the hard drive and checked the code. As soon as he opened the README file, the first line was mvn install -DskipTest</p><p><strong><strong>The code had *<em><em>never</em></em>* been tested.</strong></strong></p><p>In other words, the code was live without ever passing a single quality check. The old codebase was called <a href=\"https://blog.gojekengineering.com/thank-you-stan-marsh-29db553544bf\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong><strong>Stan Marsh</strong></strong></a><strong><strong>.</strong></strong> For the uninitiated, Stan Marsh is a character from South Park, and if you watch the show, you’d get the obvious reference to the famous line:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1600/1*Mk4tc6cfIHlC_f1CblNGNQ.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><blockquote><em><em>“Dude, this is pretty f****d up right here.”</em></em></blockquote><p>And thus it came to be. <strong><strong>Stan Marsh was the legacy code on which GOJEK was going to be built</strong></strong>. Because there was no test harness, it was difficult to understand which portion of the app was working, and which wasn’t. Considering the app was live, no one wanted to touch a ticking time bomb. It was… sorry, is… very much part of engineering folklore. (More on that later)</p><p>As urban legends go, Niranjan re-wrote the entire codebase in Golang, a language he didn’t know. Three nights. A dozen Redbulls. Two dozen coffees. Golang could handle concurrency, manage load; the kind GOJEK was witnessing. The mothership was ready. Or so the team thought.</p><p>It wasn’t an easy decision to go with Golang. Not many knew the programming language. But some risks are worth taking — and that defines good engineering from great. Luckily, this initial decision-making set the tone for the team; learn, experiment, adapt, take responsibility or be disrupted. In a month, GOJEK’s driver count tripled. But… there were more problems to come.
