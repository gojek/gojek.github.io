As we spread out from Jakarta,\nsatiating the hunger of millions of customers in most parts of Indonesia, GoFood\nas a product got increasingly complicated. Orders started to pile up, and we\nwere struggling to keep up with the skyrocketing demand. If we wanted to keep up\nwith users’ expectations, a few things needed to be done. We had to change, and\nsimultaneously up our game.\n\nIt’s a VUCA world, and we often remind ourselves that not a lot of things are\nconstant. We’ve been working hard to reimagine, re-engineer and redesign the\nGoFood flow which hasn’t been altered too much for many years.\n\nTo help you understand how it all started, let’s take you back in time a little\nbit…\n\nWhen the Gojek app for ride-hailing was launched in early 2015, we noticed there\nwere times when our driver partners had lean work periods. To provide additional\nmeans to help them make use of this time and earn more, GoSend (to send\ncouriers) and GoShop (to buy anything) were launched as auxiliary services.\n\n> We noticed that majority of orders placed in GoShop were for food. This gave way\nto GoFood, our dedicated food delivery product, launched in mid-2015.\nPhase 1: Listing Model\nGoFood started as a concierge model, where we had no tie-ups with restaurants. A\nSalesforce was deployed to list as many restaurant menus as possible on our\nplatform. When a customer placed an order, it would be assigned to one of our\ndriver partners, who would then go and place the order at the restaurant. The\ndriver partner would wait around, and when the order was ready, pay in cash,\npickup the order and deliver it to the customer.\n\nTedious? Yes. Scalable? No. 🤷‍\n\n\nPhase 2: Partnering With Merchants\nTo arrive at a scalable solution, we realised we had to take the restaurant\nmerchants along with us in this journey and welcome them into our ecosystem. We\nstarted partnering with the merchants, who were known as ‘GoFood Partners’.\n\n> This not only helped our merchants grow their businesses, but also got ample\nvisibility boost on GoFood.\nEven after onboarding them into our ecosystem, a large part of the process was\nmanual. It was far from ideal because there was no record of transactions\nbesides a booking on GoFood and a receipt handed to the driver partner.\n\nOften there were discrepancies in the number of orders assigned and the number\nof orders completed. How, you ask?\n\nImagine a GoFood partner who is part of a large chain of restaurants. When\nsomeone orders food from this chain, GoFood assigns this order to one outlet.\nHowever, the driver partner may decide to visit another outlet and pick up the\norder, as per convenience.\n\nThere were more problems galore.\n\nIf a merchant partner was not open for business on a particular day, and wanted\nto update their menu, or indicate items as out of stock, they had to call the\nGojek Customer Care. During this time, orders would still be coming in, which\nresulted in driver partners accepting orders that most certainly couldn’t be\ncompleted without a hassle.\n\nThere was a lot that needed fixing here, and it could only be done by\nintegrating merchants more deeply into our ecosystem. So, that’s exactly what we\ndid.\n\nPhase 3: The merchant app, GoResto\nTowards the end of 2016, a concept was developed for an app that would cater to\nmerchant partners, and by early 2017 GoResto (which is what we called it at the\ntime) was ready.\n\nWe introduced the following in GoResto:\n\n1. Electronic payments\nAll of Gojek’s driver partners had GoPay e-wallets associated with their\naccounts. With GoResto, we did the same for our GoFood partners. Transactions\nbetween driver and GoFood partners was directly wallet-to-wallet, hence,\ncashless.\n\n2. PIN exchange for restaurant verification\nTo ensure the order is secured, driver partners would also need to share a PIN\nwith the merchant while picking up the order. This electronic handshake helped\nus verify they were indeed picking up the right order from the right outlet.\n\n3. Catalog management\nWe noticed a lot of cancellations were happening because the items were either\nout of stock, restaurants were closed or customers were generally skeptical\nabout ordering dishes that didn’t have enough reference images. So, we started\nfocussing more on improving the product experience for our customers and BCR\n(booking completion rate). Catalog management was introduced so that the\nmerchants could regularly update details that customers saw on GoFood. For\nexample: Availability status of dishes that were put on the menu, uploading\ndetails pertaining to different items sold, etc.\n\nIn the meanwhile, GoResto was rebranded to GoBiz. What started off as a product\nthat helped merchants to manage their food orders, started evolving into\nsomething bigger. Since the scope extended beyond GoFood, calling it ‘GoResto’\nmade no sense.\n\nThe rebranding came with enhanced features in GoBiz. As you might’ve guessed, it\nalso came with new, enhanced problems and a sub-optimal flow:\n\n⚠️ The driver partner was ready, but the food wasn’t\n> The average time taken for a driver partner was:\n~9 minutes to pick up an order\n~19 minutes to deliver the order\nA portion of this time was spent by the driver waiting for the food to be\nprepared, because in most cases, GoFood partners started preparing food only\nafter the driver arrived! This was mostly because customer would add more food\nitems or the ordered items would be out of stock. We figured that the driver\narrival time could be parallelised with the food prep time. This led to 2\nimportant things:\n\n * Overall delivery time for the customer could be reduced\n * Wait time for the driver could be utilised to fulfil other orders\n\n️️️⚠️ GoFood Partner-driven cancellations existed, accountability didn’t\nGoFood partners had the ability to set their open hours and change item\navailability, but they didn’t always keep it updated. When cancellations\npertaining to these reasons happened, they were handled by…the driver partners.\n🤦‍♀️\nThis meant, the orders had to be cancelled either by the driver partners or the\ncustomers themselves.\n\n> Items being out of stock or restaurants being closed accounted for over 35% of\nall customer cancellations after a driver was assigned.\nOn the driver side, these accounted for over 75% of all driver cancellations. 😓\n⚠️ Price edits became pricey\nIn this order flow, the driver placed the final order with the merchant. This\nessentially means that the original order placed by the customer could be\nmodified due to various reasons: Incorrect listing of price, unavailability of\nitems, adding new items to the order, etc. To accommodate these cases, drivers\nwere allowed to input to final price of the order, leading to a price edit.\n\nAnd price edits aren’t uncommon. They happen to ~34% of the orders.\n\nMultiple moving pieces exposed these orders to skip payments or consumer wallet\nsweeps.\n\nPhase 4: Introducing Merchant Acceptance Flow\nDue to various reasons, our driver partners were handling GoFood partner-driven\ncancellations and heavy-lifting to ensure the orders were fulfilled. This, too,\nhad to change.\n\nAfter brainstorming, mind-mapping and head-scratching, we arrived at Merchant\nAccept Flow (MAF). The merchants who are onboarded to MAF are called Super\nPartners. The solution lets our Super Partners accept/reject orders based on the\nrestaurant being open, availability of items, or any other factors that\ndetermine order fulfilment or cancellation. This in turn helps our customers and\ndriver partners know that the merchant is preparing food for sure, so that there\nare no customer or driver cancellations.\n\nIn Part-2 of this blog, we’ll dive deep into Merchant Acceptance Flow, how we\nwent about designing it and introducing Super Partners to our customers.

Transactions between driver and GoFood partners was directly wallet-to-wallet, hence, cashless.</p><h4 id=\"2-pin-exchange-for-restaurant-verification\">2. PIN exchange for restaurant verification</h4><p>To ensure the order is secured, driver partners would also need to share a PIN with the merchant while picking up the order. This electronic handshake helped us verify they were indeed picking up the right order from the right outlet.</p><h4 id=\"3-catalog-management\">3. Catalog management</h4><p>We noticed a lot of cancellations were happening because the items were either out of stock, restaurants were closed or customers were generally skeptical about ordering dishes that didn’t have enough reference images. So, we started focussing more on improving the product experience for our customers and BCR (booking completion rate). Catalog management was introduced so that the merchants could regularly update details that customers saw on GoFood. For example: Availability status of dishes that were put on the menu, uploading details pertaining to different items sold, etc.</p><p>In the meanwhile, GoResto was rebranded to GoBiz. What started off as a product that helped merchants to manage their food orders, started evolving into something bigger. Since the scope extended beyond GoFood, calling it ‘GoResto’ made no sense.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*UTfTFeb5u4dc8PbMRnyYtA.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>The rebranding came with enhanced features in GoBiz. As you might’ve guessed, it also came with new, enhanced problems and a sub-optimal flow:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*7ZHFNcogEuyAGZ86zomAuw.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><h4 id=\"-the-driver-partner-was-ready-but-the-food-wasn-t\">⚠️ The driver partner was ready, but the food wasn’t</h4><blockquote>The average time taken for a driver partner was:<br>~9 minutes to pick up an order<br>~19 minutes to deliver the order</blockquote><p>A portion of this time was spent by the driver waiting for the food to be prepared, because in most cases, GoFood partners started preparing food only after the driver arrived! This was mostly because customer would add more food items or the ordered items would be out of stock. We figured that the driver arrival time could be parallelised with the food prep time. This led to 2 important things:</p><ul><li>Overall delivery time for the customer could be reduced</li><li>Wait time for the driver could be utilised to fulfil other orders</li></ul><h4 id=\"-gofood-partner-driven-cancellations-existed-accountability-didn-t\">️️️⚠️ GoFood Partner-driven cancellations existed, accountability didn’t</h4><p>GoFood partners had the ability to set their open hours and change item availability, but they didn’t always keep it updated. When cancellations pertaining to these reasons happened, they were handled by…the driver partners. 🤦‍♀️<br>This meant, the orders had to be cancelled either by the driver partners or the customers themselves.</p><blockquote>Items being out of stock or restaurants being closed accounted for over 35% of all customer cancellations after a driver was assigned.<br>On the driver side, these accounted for over 75% of all driver cancellations. 😓</blockquote><h4 id=\"-price-edits-became-pricey\">⚠️ Price edits became pricey</h4><p>In this order flow, the driver placed the final order with the merchant. This essentially means that the original order placed by the customer could be modified due to various reasons: Incorrect listing of price, unavailability of items, adding new items to the order, etc. To accommodate these cases, drivers were allowed to input to final price of the order, leading to a price edit.</p><h3 id=\"and-price-edits-aren-t-uncommon-they-happen-to-34-of-the-orders-\"><em>And price edits aren’t uncommon. They happen to ~34% of the orders.</em></h3><p><br>Multiple moving pieces exposed these orders to skip payments or consumer wallet sweeps.</p><h3 id=\"phase-4-introducing-merchant-acceptance-flow\">Phase 4: Introducing Merchant Acceptance Flow</h3><p>Due to various reasons, our driver partners were handling GoFood partner-driven cancellations and heavy-lifting to ensure the orders were fulfilled. This, too, had to change.</p><p>After brainstorming, mind-mapping and head-scratching, we arrived at Merchant Accept Flow (MAF). The merchants who are onboarded to MAF are called Super Partners. The solution lets our Super Partners accept/reject orders based on the restaurant being open, availability of items, or any other factors that determine order fulfilment or cancellation. This in turn helps our customers and driver partners know that the merchant is preparing food for sure, so that there are no customer or driver cancellations.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*5FbUDwJLqdnyjJIPwbaOYQ.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>In Part-2 of this blog, we’ll dive deep into Merchant Acceptance Flow, how we went about designing it and introducing Super Partners to our customers.

How do such diverse people come together and build\namazing things? That’s where Program Management comes into the picture.\n\nThe Challenge\nGoMerchants PDG was formed from five separate teams (SPOTS, Midtrans, Mapan,\nGoResto, Nadipos), and each team had a unique engineering culture. Across teams,\nthe total number of staff involved in cross-functional work was ~240 people.\n\nAfter a discovery phase of the process over 3 months with the various groups, we\nfound that every team was utilising different versions of project management\nmethodology and tools to track team progress. Across various teams, we\nidentified nearly a dozen different types of tools and methods including the\nScrum method, Kanban method, Jira tools, Favro Tools, and Trello tools.\n\nThe key takeaway was clear: There was no single source of truth for tracking\nteam deployment progress.\n\nThe Solution\nTo achieve our goal of reaching a high rate of (quality) deliverables with clear\ntransparency on progress, the Program Managers decided to build a program that\nset a single standard workflow for everyone involved. The end result? A meld of\nAgile best practices and a limited/select set of tools.\n\nAt the highest level, Program Management methodology focuses on adding just \nenough processes to help with efficiency — and not creating convoluted processes\nfor the sake of process. Keeping these best practices in mind, the workflow\nbuilt by the GoMerchants Program Management team entailed Scrum Process to track\nbacklog priority, using Confluence as a documentation hub, Jira for managing\nbacklog tasks, Pre-Iteration Planning Meetings, Sprint Planning, Daily Standups,\nand lastly, conducting regular Retrospectives.\n\nThe consolidated approach helped the GoMerchants team reach the rapid pace\nneeded to hit targeting of deliverables— but also helped support the team in an\nenvironment of rapidly-changing requirements via greater transparency.\n\nThere were additional benefits to this approach, as well: Instantaneous feedback\nfrom the team on what was working (and what was not), metrics to inform future\niterations of the workflow, and a reduction in deployment failure — and rollback\ndeployment risk — thanks to rapid and continuous internal communication.\n\n> “Agile software development is an approach to software development under which\nrequirements and solutions evolve through the collaborative effort of\nself-organizing and cross-functional teams and their customer(s)/end user(s).” —\nCollier, Ken W. (2011). Agile Analytics: A Value-Driven Approach to Business\nIntelligence and Data Warehousing. Pearson Education.\nTo transform quality deployment with high pace targets, the program implemented\nfar better collaboration for a large team than previously existed.\n\nAt the same time, Jira was chosen as the one crucial tool for backlog management\nfor GoMerchants. The factors in selecting Jira were the platform functionality\nis highly-configurable to the specific requirements of a team, as well, as it\nhas the flexibility to allow for usage in a wide variety of environments and\nprocesses.\n\nScrum Activities\nBelow is the flow of scrum activity. It starts from Pre-Iteration Planning\nMeeting (Pre-IPM), Retrospective, IPM/Sprint Planning, and Daily Standup:\n\nSprints\nA Sprint is a time-box of iterations, where the releasable works that align with\nsprint goals are implemented. A Sprint always has a fixed start and end date —\nthese dates should be of the same duration; typically two weeks.\n\nSource: Essential Scrum: A Practical Guide to the Most Popular Agile Process\nSprints notes: While most of GoMerchants PDG uses two-week sprints, the length\nof time can depend on several factors like the final deadline, number of people\nin the team, and holidays in the calendar. Some teams use a one-week Sprint\ncycle due to urgent work that requires moving at an accelerated pace. But,\ngenerally it is not a best practice to use one-week sprint cycles as team\nachievement moments can be missed, quality could be sacrificed, and team\nburn-out is a real risk.\n\nPre-I.P.M. (Pre-Iteration Planning Meeting)\nPre-IPM is an activity to review the active Sprint and manage backlog and Sprint\ngoal(s) for the next iteration. Pre-IPM is attended by a Product Manager, Tech\nLeads, and Program Manager. The Product Manager should write-up the ‘story’ aka\nplan, in Jira after Pre-IPM. Tech lead should advise if the story and goals for\nthe next iteration are technically achievable.\n\nAs a Program Manager, you can use spreadsheets for mapping between the story and\nteam before doing the IPM. Below is the example:\n\nPre-IPM notes: This is basically a small meeting with a PM, TechLead, HoE/HoP\n(if necessary) and PgM. The purpose is to finalise the work backlog for the team\nin the upcoming Sprint. This meeting will help streamline the Sprint Planning\nmeeting by confirming that the final requirements have been aligned by all\nstakeholders — the goal being to reduce the number of “Requirement Changes”\ngoing forward. .\n\nRetrospective\nThe purpose of a retrospective in IPM is to collect previous sprint feedback\nfrom the team. It contains some columns like:\n\n * Glad: What makes you happy in this sprint or things that went well\n * Sad: What makes you sad in this sprint and from here we can see how we can\n   improve it\n * Mad: What makes you mad or frustrated in this sprint\n * Ideas: Idea to improve our next sprint\n * Appreciation: Appreciation in this sprint, esp if there’s a pretty big team\n   achievement\n * Action Item: Action item to improve our next sprint based on Sad, Mad, and\n   Ideas columns. This is the important part to be followed up so “lesson\n   learned” value from every sprint is really working\n\nWe can use several tools to help us collect data, i.e. https://funretro.io/,\nbelow is the example:\n\nSend a retrospective link to a Slack channel before IPM and encourage the team\nto fill the cards. Do the retrospective by talking through each column 15–30\nminutes before IPM starts.\n\nRetrospective notes: This session provides the opportunity for a team to look\nback and see how they can improve. Retrospectives can be a catalyst for\norganisational change, team change or even a culture change. The Retrospective\ncan be a place to build and enable teams, or to help teams start their journey\nwith a clear understanding of where to go next.

To achieve this, multiple Product Development Groups (PDG) exist within Gojek. One of these is the GoMerchants PDG, that handles all our merchant-centric initiatives, including GoBiz, our SuperApp for merchant partners.</p><p>GoMerchants is an entity formed by the fusion of multiple teams that all had their own work styles. How do such diverse people come together and build amazing things? That’s where Program Management comes into the picture.</p><h3 id=\"the-challenge\">The Challenge</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*BOZMTMudwppvAHi6\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>GoMerchants PDG was formed from five separate teams (SPOTS, Midtrans, Mapan, GoResto, Nadipos), and each team had a unique engineering culture. Across teams, the total number of staff involved in cross-functional work was ~240 people.</p><p>After a discovery phase of the process over 3 months with the various groups, we found that every team was utilising different versions of project management methodology and tools to track team progress. Across various teams, we identified nearly a dozen different types of tools and methods including the Scrum method, Kanban method, Jira tools, Favro Tools, and Trello tools.</p><p>The key takeaway was clear: There was no single source of truth for tracking team deployment progress.</p><h3 id=\"the-solution\">The Solution</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*xz0BID0wK762a3It\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>To achieve our goal of reaching a high rate of (quality) deliverables with clear transparency on progress, the Program Managers decided to build a program that set a single standard workflow for everyone involved. The end result? A meld of Agile best practices and a limited/select set of tools.</p><p>At the highest level, Program Management methodology focuses on adding just<em><em> </em></em>enough processes to help with efficiency — and not creating convoluted processes for the sake of process. Keeping these best practices in mind, the workflow built by the GoMerchants Program Management team entailed Scrum Process to track backlog priority, using Confluence as a documentation hub, Jira for managing backlog tasks, Pre-Iteration Planning Meetings, Sprint Planning, Daily Standups, and lastly, conducting regular Retrospectives.</p><p>The consolidated approach helped the GoMerchants team reach the rapid pace needed to hit targeting of deliverables— but also helped support the team in an environment of rapidly-changing requirements via greater transparency.</p><p>There were additional benefits to this approach, as well: Instantaneous feedback from the team on what was working (and what was not), metrics to inform future iterations of the workflow, and a reduction in deployment failure — and rollback deployment risk — thanks to rapid and continuous internal communication.</p><blockquote><em><em>“Agile software development is an approach to software development under which requirements and solutions evolve through the collaborative effort of self-organizing and cross-functional teams and their customer(s)/end user(s).” — Collier, Ken W. (2011). Agile Analytics: A Value-Driven Approach to Business Intelligence and Data Warehousing. Pearson Education.</em></em></blockquote><p>To transform quality deployment with high pace targets, the program implemented far better collaboration for a large team than previously existed.</p><p>At the same time, Jira was chosen as the one crucial tool for backlog management for GoMerchants. The factors in selecting Jira were the platform functionality is highly-configurable to the specific requirements of a team, as well, as it has the flexibility to allow for usage in a wide variety of environments and processes.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*6BKaz05opZRwL9_K\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><h3 id=\"scrum-activities\">Scrum Activities</h3><p>Below is the flow of scrum activity. It starts from Pre-Iteration Planning Meeting (Pre-IPM), Retrospective, IPM/Sprint Planning, and Daily Standup:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/538/0*gTaqBaLJp4SmH04h\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><h3 id=\"sprints\">Sprints</h3><p>A Sprint is a time-box of iterations, where the releasable works that align with sprint goals are implemented. A Sprint always has a <strong><strong>fixed </strong></strong>start and end date — these dates should be of the same duration; typically two weeks.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1100/0*FW1FhCEHTQr-94pp\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Source: Essential Scrum: A Practical Guide to the Most Popular Agile Process\"><figcaption><em>Source: Essential Scrum: A Practical Guide to the Most Popular Agile Process</em></figcaption></figure><p>Sprints notes: While most of GoMerchants PDG uses two-week sprints, the length of time can depend on several factors like the final deadline, number of people in the team, and holidays in the calendar. Some teams use a one-week Sprint cycle due to urgent work that requires moving at an accelerated pace. But, generally it is not a best practice to use one-week sprint cycles as team achievement moments can be missed, quality could be sacrificed, and team burn-out is a real risk.</p><h3 id=\"pre-i-p-m-pre-iteration-planning-meeting-\">Pre-I.P.M. (Pre-Iteration Planning Meeting)</h3><p>Pre-IPM is an activity to review the active Sprint and manage backlog and Sprint goal(s) for the next iteration. Pre-IPM is attended by a Product Manager, Tech Leads, and Program Manager. The Product Manager should write-up the ‘story’ aka plan, in Jira after Pre-IPM. Tech lead should advise if the story and goals for the next iteration are technically achievable.</p><p>As a Program Manager, you can use spreadsheets for mapping between the story and team before doing the IPM. Below is the example:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/739/0*nScsmP0TJmMn21oF\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>Pre-IPM notes: This is basically a small meeting with a PM, TechLead, HoE/HoP (if necessary) and PgM. The purpose is to finalise the work backlog for the team in the upcoming Sprint. This meeting will help streamline the Sprint Planning meeting by confirming that the final requirements have been aligned by all stakeholders — the goal being to reduce the number of “Requirement Changes” going forward. .</p><h2 id=\"retrospective\"><strong>Retrospective</strong></h2><p>The purpose of a retrospective in IPM is to collect previous sprint feedback from the team. It contains some columns like:</p><ul><li><strong><strong>Glad</strong></strong>: What makes you happy in this sprint or things that went well</li><li><strong><strong>Sad</strong></strong>: What makes you sad in this sprint and from here we can see how we can improve it</li><li><strong><strong>Mad</strong></strong>: What makes you mad or frustrated in this sprint</li><li><strong><strong>Ideas</strong></strong>: Idea to improve our next sprint</li><li><strong><strong>Appreciation</strong></strong>: Appreciation in this sprint, esp if there’s a pretty big team achievement</li><li><strong><strong>Action Item</strong></strong>: Action item to improve our next sprint based on Sad, Mad, and Ideas columns. This is the important part to be followed up so “lesson learned” value from every sprint is really working</li></ul><p>We can use several tools to help us collect data, i.e. <a href=\"https://funretro.io/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://funretro.io/</a>, below is the example:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*tbPuQ0kjLePWqVsB\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>Send a retrospective link to a Slack channel before IPM and encourage the team to fill the cards. Do the retrospective by talking through each column 15–30 minutes before IPM starts.</p><p>Retrospective notes: This session provides the opportunity for a team to look back and see how they can improve. Retrospectives can be a catalyst for organisational change, team change or even a culture change. The Retrospective can be a place to build and enable teams, or to help teams start their journey with a clear understanding of where to go next. It’s a method that is very useful to gauge the Team Happiness state and gain Improvement Feedback from the team. A Retrospective also builds trust and helps make the team grow stronger as individual members know they have an outlet to express their feedback and they will be heard by their managers and colleagues. Since this process is highly actionable, the PgM’s have incorporated it beyond the use case of small teams, and have instituted it at larger scale for the entire GoMerchants PDG Org every 6 months.</p><h3 id=\"ipm-sprint-planning\">IPM/Sprint Planning</h3><p>IPM/Sprint Planning is an activity that is attended by all members of the team to prioritise the backlog, discuss stories, and determine story points.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://gojek-ghost.zysk.in/content/images/2020/06/image-7.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://gojek-ghost.zysk.in/content/images/2020/06/image-8.png\" class=\"kg-image\"><figcaption><em>Source: </em><a href=\"http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1928232\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1928232</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>Below are the steps taken in an IPM:</p><p><strong><strong>Before IPM:</strong></strong></p><ul><li>Program Manager sends a retrospective link to a Slack channel</li></ul><p><strong><strong>During IPM:</strong></strong></p><ul><li>Retrospective 15 min</li><li>Open Sprint Report to review active sprint (Done and Not Done)</li><li>Complete Sprint</li><li>Open velocity chart to review the commitment and complete stories from the previous Sprint</li><li>Ask the team who will take a leave and discuss with PM about achievement story (this will be helpful to adjust velocity for the next Sprint)</li><li>The PM explains each story for a new sprint.

Voila!! You got a driver. That was\nfast. You can see your driver’s location on the map, and the estimated time they\nwould take to come to you.\n\nBut hang on… It seems like the map is a bit messed up.\n\nThe driver location on the map goes back and forth at unreal speed, and even\nflies over buildings. Starring in an action movie is not exactly how you want to\nstart your week. 😮\n\nWhile our driver-partners sure are superman in their own unique way, they\ncertainly can’t drive over buildings. This is clearly not how your driver is\nactually driving on the road. But then why is the map showing all this?\n\nWell, there are multiple factors that can lead to a bad experience like that.\nSome within our control, some not so much (as of now). We decided to go back to\nthe drawing board and figure out the issues that are in our control and fix them\nfor good. And that is how we built a world-class (arguably 😬) live-tracking\nexperience.\n\nBut what is live-tracking, you would ask?\n\nLive tracking is a complete map experience. It doesn’t involve anything other\nthan what you see on maps after you get a driver.\n\nSo, what do you see on maps?\n\n 1. Driver's location depicted by a green marker.\n 2. The routes.\n 3. The change in driver marker as the driver moves closer to your pickup/your\n    destination.\n 4. The change in route as the driver moves.\n\nAnd that’s it. That’s all live-tracking is.\n\n> But that sounds quite simple. Right? Use some routing APIs and plot the markers\nand routes.\nWell, yes, it sounded easy to us when we first heard about it too. The real\nexperience threw us a few curveballs. Let’s go through how we create a\nlive-tracking experience.\n\nInput\nLet’s look at the input data that we need to create a live-tracking animation:\n\nDriver Location and Routes\nOur driver apps have an in-built mechanism to upload driver location to our\nbackend at regular intervals. This is how we are able to find a driver close to\nyour location when you order one of our services. The primary input to\nlive-tracking is this driver location.\n\nIn our driver app, we get this location using Android’s FusedLocationProvider \nAPI which automatically uses the best location provider(GPS, Wifi, etc). The\ndriver location is ingested into our backend system via a continuous stream.\nRoutes are generated by our internal routing engine and provided to the customer\napp.\n\nInput Source\nAs you would have guessed, this data is provided via API calls initiated by the\nour Super App to the routing engine.\n\nMaking the API call just once won’t be sufficient. Right? The app needs to be\ninformed every time the driver’s location has changed. So, the customer app\npolls this API every few seconds to get this data.\n\nNow, we have a continuous stream of data flowing to our app which has all the\ninformation that we need to show the vehicle animation on the road.\n\nTerminology\nBefore moving forward, we should get acquainted with a few terminologies that we\nwould use quite frequently in this post.\n\n 1. Route: The entire list of latitude-longitudes between the driver location to\n    the pickup/destination location.\n 2. Segment: A segment is the smallest unit of a route. It is a straight line\n    from one position in the routes list to the very next position in the routes\n    list.\n\nA route of length n has n-1 segments. Confused? Yeah, let’s take an example.\n\nA Route looks like this:\n\n[{-62441198, 106.8032959},\n{-6.2440766, 106.80328}, \n{-6.2439977, 106.8033275},\n{-6.2434893, 106.8029214},\n{-6.2433926, 106.8030539},\n{-6.2436018, 106.803222}]\n\nThere are 5 Segments in this route.\n\nSegment 1: {-6.2441198, 106.8032959,-6.2440766, 106.80328}\nSegment 2: {-6.2440766, 106.80328,-6.2439977, 106.8033275}\nSegment 3: {-6.2439977, 106.8033275,-6.2434893, 106.8029214}\nSegment 4: {-6.2434893, 106.8029214,-6.2433926, 106.8030539}\nSegment 5: {-6.2433926, 106.8030539,-6.2436018, 106.8032224}\n\nThe initial setup\nWhen the user lands on the live tracking screen, the app immediately makes a\ncall to our internal API to get the driver location and route. Once we get this\ndata, we plot it on the map using the standard GoogleMap methods. \ngoogleMap.addMarker(), googleMap.addPolyline() etc.\n\nSometimes, we don’t have the routing information available immediately, so we\njust show the driver marker. We also store this data locally in an in-memory\ncache as we would need it later to do some comparisons.\n\nSo, the customer is able to see the markers and routes on the map now. So far so\ngood.\n\nThe subsequent updates\nAs I mentioned earlier, we need to change the position of driver marker and\nroute as the driver moves. The customer app makes a call to the same internal\nAPI every few seconds. After the first response, we don’t move any markers or\nroutes on the map until the next response succeeds.\n\nIn the next response, we again get the same data points i.e the route and driver\nlocation but with different values, of course, if the driver has moved. The next\nset of data that we get can have the following characteristics:\n\n 1. Route and driver location don’t change\n 2. Route changes\n 3. Route doesn’t change BUT driver location does\n\nLet’s discuss these cases one by one.\n\n1: Route and driver location don’t change\nIf nothing has changed, we don’t need to do anything. Probably our driver\npartner is stuck in traffic. 😞\n\n2: Route changes\nThis can happen either when:\n\n 1. The app was not showing any route to the user before i.e the first response\n    didn’t have the route.\n 2. The app was showing a route that is different from the newly received route.\n    This usually happens in cases where the driver starts following a different\n    route from the one they were following before. This can also happen due to\n    road closures or simply because our driver-partner initially followed a\n    wrong route by mistake 😅.\n\nIn either of these cases, we simply ignore the old driver marker and routes\nwhich were shown and plot the new marker and routes.\n\n3: Route doesn’t change BUT driver location does\nThe app was showing the same route to the user before i.e the old response had\nthe same route as the new response. This means that the driver is following the\noriginal route that we determined.\n\nIn this case, we need to animate the driver marker on the map from the old\nlocation to the new location along the same route. This is the most common\nscenario, which can again be broken down further into multiple scenarios (yeah,\nI’m all about breaking things down 🤐).\n\n3.1: Does the new location lie on the route?\nTo animate the driver marker from it’s current position to the new location, we\nfirst need to know whether the new location lies on the route or not.\n\nYeah, we can’t be sure that the driver location that we have received would\nalways lie on the route/road because of various GPS inaccuracy issues.\n\nWe iterate through every segment in the route to find the segment which has the\nnew location. For every segment, we use the Geometry/PolyUtil library to\ndetermine whether the driver location lies on that route.\n\nWe also specify a tolerance of a few meters to account for GPS inaccuracy. So,\nif the newly received location is within a radius of X meters near a segment,\nthis method will return true.\n\nAndroid\n\nboolean isLocationOnPath(LatLng point,List<LatLng> polyline,boolean geodesic,\ndouble tolerance)\n\niOS\n\nBOOL GMSGeometryIsLocationOnPathToleranc\n[https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios-sdk/reference/group___geometry_utils#ga580ba381b9d4fbc0ff430cf69e06e66d]\ne(CLLocationCoordinate2D point,GMSPath\n[https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios-sdk/reference/interface_g_m_s_path] \n* path,BOOL geodesic,CLLocationDistance tolerance)\n\nIf the location doesn’t lie on any of the segments in the route, we are sad and\nso, we don’t animate anything. But if it does, we go forward with the next step\nwhich is….\n\n3.2: Vehicle projection on route\nWhen we receive a new location, the start location is simply the position that\nthe driver marker is already at. No logic required there to calculate that.\n\nThe end location should simply be the new location that we received. Well, in an\nideal world, it should be but we live so far away from an ideal world 😞.\n\nAs we mentioned earlier, the raw driver location that we get from the driver app\nvia GPS/other providers mostly doesn’t lie on the road. So, we have to find a\nprojection of the driver location on the road/route.\n\nIf you have been reading carefully, you might wonder why we can’t just use the \nisLocationOnPath() method above 🤔.\n\nWell, if you had been reading more carefully, you might have noticed that this\nmethod returns a boolean explaining whether the location is on/near the route or\nnot 🤦‍♂. It doesn’t return the projected location. (Ohh..if someone from Maps\nUtils stumbled upon this by chance, please add that method, good sir).\n\nSo, we had to revise some maths. Yeah, folks, learn your maths well. You never\nknow when a situation like this might arise 🤷‍♂.\n\n“Find the projection of point (x,y) on the line y = mx + c”. Does that ring a\nbell? Drawing a perpendicular line towards the segment and calculating the\nlocation of where the line and route intersect can give us the projected\nlocation. Right?\n\nWell, the above approach works for 2-D systems but earth is not a 2-D space. We\nneed a way to project the spherical surface of the earth onto a rectangle 2-D\nspace. There are several ways to do that. All of them have certain drawbacks. We\nmight lose information like direction or the shape of landmasses/countries or\nthe area information.\n\nMercator Projection\n\nMercator projection is one of the available methods to project the spherical map\nof earth onto a rectangle to make usable maps. Most of the mapping tools used\nfor navigation use this projection.\n\nThe key feature of Mercator projection is that it retains the direction\ninformation. That means if point A is 30deg east from north of point B on the\nglobe, it will be in the same direction on its Mercator projection. Or say there\nis a turn of 90deg in some lane, it will be 90deg on Mercator projection as\nwell. That is the reason it works really well for navigation purposes.\n\nHow to use a Mercator projection?\n\n 1. Every point on the earth is projected on a cylinder exactly like point A\n    which has point A’ on the cylinder.\n 2. Once all the required points/routes are projected on this cylinder. It is\n    unrolled, and we obtain a rectangle like the one shown above.\n 3. All the planar geometry can be applied with a very little margin of error on\n    this 2D projected map.\n 4. After processing all the points/routes they can be converted back to\n    latitude and longitude on the globe.\n\nSo, now we have the projected driver location on the route which we will fondly\ncall snapped point going forward.\n\n3.3: End-to-End animation\nThe new driver location that we receive can be present in any segment. It may be\nthat it is in the same segment or it may be that it is on the next segment or on\nthe next one or it may be that it is on the last segment.\n\nBut for linear animation, we need a start point and an end point. The start\npoint is the current position of the driver marker. We already got the snapped\nendpoint in the earlier section. But we can’t just animate from start to end at\nonce as that would seem like the car is flying and ignoring U-turns, routes,\netc. So, how do we prevent it from flying?\n\nWhat do you do when you can’t fly to a place? You follow the road. Right? That’s\nwhat we have to do as well. Make the driver marker follow the route/road. We\nneed to animate along each segment in the route until we reach the segment which\nhas the driver position that we received.\n\nThere are again two cases here 😜:\n\n3.3.1: The new driver location is on the same segment\nIn this case, we can directly animate from the current position of driver marker\nto the driver location that we received since this is just a straight line\nanimation.\n\nA segment is always a straight line. We will discuss more on how to do the\nanimation b/w 2 points in a later section.\n\n3.3.2: The new driver location is on a different segment\nIn this case, we need to animate to that segment along the route. We have to\nanimate along each of the segments in between to reach the final segment.\n\nFor animation along the first segment, we set the endpoint of the animation to\nthe beginning of the next segment in the route. We animate to the end of the\nfirst segment.\n\nThe next segment may also not have the driver location that we received. After a\ndriver has traversed the first segment, we move the end location of the\nanimation to the end of the next segment, and so on and so forth till we reach\nthe last segment. Confusing, ya? Let’s see an example.\n\nSo much zig-zag (huh!!)The car icon(A) represents the location in the segment\nwhere the driver marker currently is. The red pin(X) represents the new snapped\nlocation received.\n\nIn the 1st animation, we move the driver marker from A to the end of the first\nsegment (B).\n\nIn the 2nd animation, the driver marker is moved through the entire length of\nthe 2nd segment.\n\nAnd so on and so forth till we reach the segment which has the newly received\nsnapped location (X).\n\nAnimation in a segment\nWe now know how the overall animation would look like. But we also need to\nconfigure how the smallest unit of the animation i.e animation in a segment\nshould happen.\n\nStart point and End point: For case #1 above, the animation in a segment will\nhappen just once. For case #2 above, this animation in a segment will happen\nmultiple times. Start and endpoints will be determined before beginning each of\nthe animations.\n\nBearing b/w these two points: Bearing can be calculated using another one of\nGeometry/Maps Utils method.\n\nSphericalUtil.computeHeading(startPosition, endPosition)\n\nDuration of animation: Calculating duration is a bit tricky. And the duration is\nthe most important thing in any animation. Sometimes the difference b/w a smooth\nand a choppy animation is caused by the duration. It was very important that we\ngot it right. So, let’s take a break and see how to calculate the duration.\n\nWhat is Duration?\nIt’s the amount of time for which the animation should happen. But you already\nknow that. Going back to middle school maths (yeah, that far), how do you\ncalculate time? Time is nothing but distance divided by speed. Correct?\nCalculating straight line distance b/w the two points we want to animate through\nis pretty easy.\n\nSphericalUtil.computeDistanceBetween(startLocation, endLocation)\n\nCool, cool. But what about speed? How should we calculate speed?\n\nSpeed calculation\nFusedLocationProvider API in the driver app does provide the speed of the\nvehicle but it’s highly unreliable. So, we have to employ some tricks to\ncalculate the speed.\n\nSpeed is distance divided by time. Distance again!! Seems like we are running in\ncircles 😵. Not exactly. Here the distance is not the straight line distance b/w\nthe two points that we have to animate through.\n\nThis is the total distance along the route from the segment that the old driver\nlocation is currently located at, to the segment where the new driver location\nis. Yeah, that statement is a bit confusing. So, let’s take an example.\n\nThe car icon(A) represents the location in the segment where the driver marker\ncurrently is. The red pin(X) represents the new snapped location received. To\ncalculate the distance, we do the obvious:\n\nTotal distance = d1 + d2 + d3 + d4\n\nNow, we have the distance. We need the time interval.\n\nThe FusedLocationProvider API in the driver app does provide us the timestamp at\nwhich a location was updated. And this information is passed to our backend and\nsubsequently to the customer app.\n\nWe calculate the time difference b/w the old driver location and the new driver\nlocation using their timestamps. Wait, how do we know the old driver location?\nAs we had mentioned earlier, we cache the last available driver location and\nroute in an in-memory cache.\n\nTotal route distance divided by time and now we have the speed for the entire\nduration. Linear distance divided by this speed and now we have the durationfor\na single animation in a segment. Cool, so let’s get back to the point where we\nbroke off 😅.\n\nUpdate the animation\nWith all the above information, we start the animation. But wait? Aren’t we\nmissing something? We did start an animation b/w two points but how will our\nanimator know how to animate?\n\nAnimation is just a bunch of frame updates that happen every fast. How do we\nupdate the marker position, the starting point of the route, the rotation in\neach and every frame of the animation? Well, the mobile/web framework allows us\nto do something every time the frame is updated.\n\nBut what is this something that we should do?\n\n1. Update marker’s position\nFor markers, we need to update their position. Once we have the position, we can\nsimply update the marker position using the marker.setPosition(). To find the\nposition during each frame of the animation, we need the percentage of animation\nthat has elapsed.\n\nWe can get the percentage from the Animation framework. Using this percentage\nand the start and end position, we calculate the intermediate position/s like\nthis:\n\nSphericalUtil.interpolate(startPosition, endPosition, fraction)\n\n2. Update Routes\nRoutes need to be aligned with the marker’s movement. So, we update the routes\nas well using the values above and updating the polyline points of that route\nusing the polyline.setPoints().\n\nAnd that’s a wrap. The result that we get is a very smooth, measured movement of\nthe vehicle along the road.\n\nThere are a few more tips/tricks that we employ to ensure that there are no\nabrupt changes in the animation.\n\nBut that’s for next time. 😃\n\nWhat’s next?\nWe still need to go a long way to meet the standards that we have set for\nourselves. Currently, this new experience is only rolled out to GoRide, GoCar,\nand GoBluebird. We are working on bringing the same experience to other services\nlike GoFood, GoSend, and GoShop.

Voila!! You got a driver. That was fast. You can see your driver’s location on the map, and the estimated time they would take to come to you.</p><p><em><em>But hang on… It seems like the map is a bit messed up.</em></em></p><p>The driver location on the map goes back and forth at unreal speed, and even flies over buildings. Starring in an action movie is not exactly how you want to start your week. 😮</p><p>While our driver-partners sure are superman in their own unique way, they certainly can’t drive over buildings. This is clearly not how your driver is actually driving on the road. But then why is the map showing all this?</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://gojek-ghost.zysk.in/content/images/2020/05/LiveTracking2.gif\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>Well, there are multiple factors that can lead to a bad experience like that. Some within our control, some not so much (as of now). We decided to go back to the drawing board and figure out the issues that are in our control and fix them for good. And that is how we built a world-class (arguably 😬) live-tracking experience.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://gojek-ghost.zysk.in/content/images/2020/05/image.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>But what is live-tracking, you would ask?</p><p>Live tracking is a complete map experience. It doesn’t involve anything other than what you see on maps after you get a driver.</p><p>So, what do you see on maps?</p><ol><li>Driver's location depicted by a green marker.</li><li>The routes.</li><li>The change in driver marker as the driver moves closer to your pickup/your destination.</li><li>The change in route as the driver moves.</li></ol><p>And that’s it. That’s all live-tracking is.</p><blockquote><em><em>But that sounds quite simple. Right? Use some routing APIs and plot the markers and routes.</em></em></blockquote><p>Well, yes, it sounded easy to us when we first heard about it too. The real experience threw us a few curveballs. Let’s go through how we create a live-tracking experience.</p><h3 id=\"input\">Input</h3><p>Let’s look at the input data that we need to create a live-tracking animation:</p><h3 id=\"driver-location-and-routes\">Driver Location and Routes</h3><p>Our driver apps have an in-built mechanism to upload driver location to our backend at regular intervals. This is how we are able to find a driver close to your location when you order one of our services. The primary input to live-tracking is this driver location.</p><p>In our driver app, we get this location using Android’s <code>FusedLocationProvider</code> API which automatically uses the best location provider(GPS, Wifi, etc). The driver location is ingested into our backend system via a continuous stream. Routes are generated by our internal routing engine and provided to the customer app.</p><h3 id=\"input-source\">Input Source</h3><p>As you would have guessed, this data is provided via API calls initiated by the our Super App to the routing engine.</p><p>Making the API call just once won’t be sufficient. Right? The app needs to be informed every time the driver’s location has changed. So, the customer app polls this API every few seconds to get this data.</p><p>Now, we have a continuous stream of data flowing to our app which has all the information that we need to show the vehicle animation on the road.</p><h3 id=\"terminology\">Terminology</h3><p>Before moving forward, we should get acquainted with a few terminologies that we would use quite frequently in this post.</p><ol><li><strong><strong>Route</strong></strong>: The entire list of latitude-longitudes between the driver location to the pickup/destination location.</li><li><strong><strong>Segment</strong></strong>: A segment is the smallest unit of a route. It is a straight line from one position in the routes list to the very next position in the routes list.</li></ol><p>A route of length n has n-1 segments. Confused? Yeah, let’s take an example.</p><p>A <strong><strong>Route</strong></strong> looks like this:</p><p>[{-6<code>2441198, 106.8032959},<br>{-6.2440766, 106.80328}, <br>{-6.2439977, 106.8033275},<br>{-6.2434893, 106.8029214},<br>{-6.2433926, 106.8030539},<br>{-6.2436018, 106.803222}]</code></p><p>There are 5 <strong><strong>Segments</strong></strong> in this route.</p><p><code>Segment 1: {-6.2441198, 106.8032959,-6.2440766, 106.80328}</code><br><code>Segment 2: {-6.2440766, 106.80328,-6.2439977, 106.8033275}</code><br><code>Segment 3: {-6.2439977, 106.8033275,-6.2434893, 106.8029214}</code><br><code>Segment 4: {-6.2434893, 106.8029214,-6.2433926, 106.8030539}</code><br><code>Segment 5: {-6.2433926, 106.8030539,-6.2436018, 106.8032224}</code></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://gojek-ghost.zysk.in/content/images/2020/05/image-1.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><h3 id=\"the-initial-setup\">The initial setup</h3><p>When the user lands on the live tracking screen, the app immediately makes a call to our internal API to get the driver location and route. Once we get this data, we plot it on the map using the standard GoogleMap methods. <code><em><em>googleMap.addMarker()</em></em></code><em><em>, </em></em><code><em><em>googleMap.addPolyline()</em></em></code> etc.</p><p>Sometimes, we don’t have the routing information available immediately, so we just show the driver marker. We also store this data locally in an in-memory cache as we would need it later to do some comparisons.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/436/1*k9IpgQ4ss-bhKHBY5ETUgg.gif\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>So, the customer is able to see the markers and routes on the map now. So far so good.</p><h3 id=\"the-subsequent-updates\">The subsequent updates</h3><p>As I mentioned earlier, we need to change the position of driver marker and route as the driver moves. The customer app makes a call to the same internal API every few seconds. After the first response, we don’t move any markers or routes on the map until the next response succeeds.</p><p>In the next response, we again get the same data points i.e the route and driver location but with different values, of course, <strong><strong>if the driver has moved</strong></strong>. The next set of data that we get can have the following characteristics:</p><ol><li>Route and driver location don’t change</li><li>Route changes</li><li>Route doesn’t change BUT driver location does</li></ol><p>Let’s discuss these cases one by one.</p><h3 id=\"1-route-and-driver-location-don-t-change\">1: Route and driver location don’t change</h3><p>If nothing has changed, we don’t need to do anything. Probably our driver partner is stuck in traffic. 😞</p><h3 id=\"2-route-changes\">2: Route changes</h3><p>This can happen either when:</p><ol><li>The app was not showing any route to the user before i.e the first response didn’t have the route.</li><li>The app was showing a route that is different from the newly received route. This usually happens in cases where the driver starts following a different route from the one they were following before. This can also happen due to road closures or simply because our driver-partner initially followed a wrong route by mistake 😅.</li></ol><p>In either of these cases, we simply ignore the old driver marker and routes which were shown and plot the new marker and routes.</p><h3 id=\"3-route-doesn-t-change-but-driver-location-does\">3: Route doesn’t change BUT driver location does</h3><p>The app was showing the same route to the user before i.e the old response had the same route as the new response. This means that the driver is following the original route that we determined.</p><p>In this case, we need to animate the driver marker on the map from the old location to the new location along the same route. This is the most common scenario, which can again be broken down further into multiple scenarios (yeah, I’m all about breaking things down 🤐).</p><h3 id=\"3-1-does-the-new-location-lie-on-the-route\">3.1: Does the new location lie on the route?</h3><p>To animate the driver marker from it’s current position to the new location, we first need to know whether the new location lies on the route or not.</p><p>Yeah, we can’t be sure that the driver location that we have received would always lie on the route/road because of various GPS inaccuracy issues.</p><p>We iterate through every segment in the route to find the segment which has the new location. For every segment, we use the Geometry/PolyUtil library to determine whether the driver location lies on that route.</p><p>We also specify a tolerance of a few meters to account for GPS inaccuracy. So, if the newly received location is within a radius of <strong><strong>X meters</strong></strong> near a segment, this method will return true.</p><p><strong><strong>Android</strong></strong></p><p><code>boolean isLocationOnPath(LatLng point,List&lt;LatLng&gt; polyline,boolean geodesic, double tolerance)</code></p><p><strong><strong>iOS</strong></strong></p><p><code>BOOL <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios-sdk/reference/group___geometry_utils#ga580ba381b9d4fbc0ff430cf69e06e66d\" rel=\"noopener\">GMSGeometryIsLocationOnPathToleranc</a>e(CLLocationCoordinate2D point,<a href=\"https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios-sdk/reference/interface_g_m_s_path\" rel=\"noopener\">GMSPath</a> * path,BOOL geodesic,CLLocationDistance tolerance)</code></p><p>If the location doesn’t lie on any of the segments in the route, we are sad and so, we don’t animate anything. But if it does, we go forward with the next step which is….</p><h3 id=\"3-2-vehicle-projection-on-route\">3.2: Vehicle projection on route</h3><p>When we receive a new location, the start location is simply the position that the driver marker is already at. No logic required there to calculate that.</p><p>The end location should simply be the new location that we received. Well, in an ideal world, it <strong><strong>should be</strong></strong> but we live so far away from an ideal world 😞.</p><p>As we mentioned earlier, the raw driver location that we get from the driver app via GPS/other providers mostly doesn’t lie on the road. So, we have to find a projection of the driver location on the road/route.</p><p>If you have been reading carefully, you might wonder why we can’t just use the <em><em>isLocationOnPath()</em></em> method above 🤔.</p><p>Well, if you had been reading <em><em>more</em></em> carefully, you might have noticed that this method returns a boolean explaining whether the location is on/near the route or not 🤦‍♂. It doesn’t return the projected location. (Ohh..if someone from Maps Utils stumbled upon this by chance, please add that method, good sir).</p><p>So, we had to revise some maths. Yeah, folks, learn your maths well. You never know when a situation like this might arise 🤷‍♂.</p><p><em><em>“Find the projection of point (x,y) on the line y = mx + c”.</em></em> Does that ring a bell? Drawing a perpendicular line towards the segment and calculating the location of where the line and route intersect can give us the projected location. Right?</p><p>Well, the above approach works for 2-D systems but earth is not a 2-D space. We need a way to project the spherical surface of the earth onto a rectangle 2-D space. There are several ways to do that. All of them have certain drawbacks. We might lose information like direction or the shape of landmasses/countries or the area information.</p><p><strong><strong>Mercator Projection</strong></strong></p><p>Mercator projection is one of the available methods to project the spherical map of earth onto a rectangle to make usable maps. Most of the mapping tools used for navigation use this projection.</p><p>The key feature of Mercator projection is that it retains the direction information. That means if point A is 30deg east from north of point B on the globe, it will be in the same direction on its Mercator projection. Or say there is a turn of 90deg in some lane, it will be 90deg on Mercator projection as well. That is the reason it works really well for navigation purposes.</p><p><strong><strong>How to use a Mercator projection?</strong></strong></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://gojek-ghost.zysk.in/content/images/2020/05/image-4.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://gojek-ghost.zysk.in/content/images/2020/05/image-5.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><ol><li>Every point on the earth is projected on a cylinder exactly like point A which has point A’ on the cylinder.</li><li>Once all the required points/routes are projected on this cylinder. It is unrolled, and we obtain a rectangle like the one shown above.</li><li>All the planar geometry can be applied with a very little margin of error on this 2D projected map.</li><li>After processing all the points/routes they can be converted back to latitude and longitude on the globe.</li></ol><p>So, now we have the projected driver location on the route which we will fondly call <code>snapped point</code> going forward.</p><h3 id=\"3-3-end-to-end-animation\">3.3: End-to-End animation</h3><p>The new driver location that we receive can be present in <strong><strong>any</strong></strong> segment. It may be that it is in the same segment or it may be that it is on the next segment or on the next one or it may be that it is on the last segment.</p><p>But for linear animation, we need a start point and an end point. The start point is the current position of the driver marker. We already got the snapped endpoint in the earlier section. But we can’t just animate from start to end <strong><strong>at once</strong></strong> as that would seem like the car is flying and ignoring U-turns, routes, etc. So, how do we prevent it from flying?</p><p>What do you do when you can’t fly to a place? You follow the road. Right? That’s what we have to do as well. Make the driver marker follow the route/road. We need to animate along each segment in the route until we reach the segment which has the driver position that we received.</p><p>There are again two cases here 😜:</p><h3 id=\"3-3-1-the-new-driver-location-is-on-the-same-segment\">3.3.1: The new driver location is on the same segment</h3><p>In this case, we can directly animate from the current position of driver marker to the driver location that we received since this is just a straight line animation.</p><p>A segment is always a straight line.

It’s the only way to decide what’s working and what’s not. We\ndon’t believe that software requires a 50,000 foot overview with people\nexclusively working on the blueprint. At Gojek, writing software is not a\nlow-level task; it’s at the very core of what we do.\n\nLeaders who code are better judges of technical skill.\n\nEveryone needs to ‘walk the talk’ — We respect people who get down in the\ntrenches and take a hands-on approach to problem solving. Based on our\nexperience, standing at a distance and issuing commandments has many a time been\ninefficient and error prone, and hence we avoid this.\n\nLeaders are grown and not made — We believe in acquired respect and leadership,\nnot leadership by position. At Gojek, you earn your leadership mettle. We\nbelieve in helping our people grow into leadership roles by giving them chances,\nrisk appetite and freedom. We trust our people and support them to do the right\nthing at any given moment. In my own career, I’ve been privileged enough to have\nfound some amazing mentors, and I am glad to be able to continue the legacy at\nGojek.\n\nEvery decision is correct at the time it is made — Swift decision-making is\nextremely important in a fast paced environment like ours. Once a decision is\nmade, we don’t constantly agonise over it or second guess. We trust that\nwhenever someone makes a decision, it is the right one, given the information\navailable to them at that time. Only the passage of time can tell us whether a\nparticular decision was right or wrong. It’s OK to change decisions, and we\nencourage people to not be afraid to make a decision.\n\nEvery person has some strengths, even if we don’t always see them — A great team\nis built with a group of people who have complementary skill sets. A combination\nof different strengths make teams that can tackle all kinds of situations. At\nGojek, we believe each one of us is unique and has unique strengths. It’s just a\nmatter of finding the right role to match the skills. Teams become super strong\nwhen they appreciate each other’s strengths.\n\nWorking in tech means learning all the time — Learning is important in every\nfield. In the technology industry, it is a matter of life and death. Technology\nis changing all the time, what worked a decade ago may be completely obsolete\nnow.
