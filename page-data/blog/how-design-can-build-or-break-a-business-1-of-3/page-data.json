The largest food delivery service in\nSoutheast Asia, 300,000+ merchants, 16 million menu items‚Ä¶ you get the drift.\nWith figures like that, you‚Äôd expect the GoFood user experience to be the best\nin the business.\n\nWhy then, did nearly 20% of GoFood users leave the checkout flow after adding\nitems to their cart?\n\nSomething wasn‚Äôt adding up.\n\nOur user flow was broken, and we needed to fix it.\n\nTL;DR: This post is part one of a three-part series highlighting the case study\nand critical considerations that went into redesigning the Checkout experience\nfor GoFood ‚Äî Gojek‚Äôs food delivery product.\n\nLights, Camera‚Ä¶ üí°üé•\nGOJEK was going through a major facelift in 2018. For a Super App with 19+\nproducts, we had all the scale-related issues one could imagine. We desperately\nneeded an efficient system for our designers and developers. This gave birth to \nAsphalt ‚Äî GOJEK‚Äôs very own Design Language System [http://asphalt.gojek.io/].\n\nThe redesign started with our transport app ‚Äî GoRide. It was then time to show\nsome love to Gojek‚Äôs prodigal child ‚Äî GoFood. The product owner walked up to to\nme and said ‚Äî ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go beyond just the UI, and rethink the entire user\nexperience, instead of ceding over features as is.‚Äù\n\nWhat he meant ‚Äî ‚ÄúGet ready! Lots of sleepless nights coming your way. We‚Äôre\ngoing to do a mammoth redesign, the likes of which minions like you will crumble\nunder.‚Äù ?\n\nüé¨ Action!\nWe wanted our redesign to solve problems with specific business constraints, and\nwe knew it was impossible to do so without delving into user problems first.\n\nFinding the right problem to solve is harder (and more important) than finding\nthe right solution.\n\nFirst comes the framework\nTo achieve this, we pinned some critical thumb-rules before embarking on our\nredesign journey:\n\n * To be data-driven. (‚ÄúDesign is not about making things pretty‚Äù ‚Äî I‚Äôm going to\n   parrot this line 10 times over in this blog and if you ever talk to meüòÖ)\n * To incorporate the existing brand perception into all designs. (Marketing\n   says fun and creative but product looks dull and boring?Problem!)\n * To empathise with users and business requirements. (Always chase the full\n   story, be user-centric and business-driven)\n\nTo put the framework to use, we started white-boarding our in-app user flow. In\nthe journey graph, we noticed a large number of users were dropping-off at our\ncheckout page. That means nearly 20% of our users who added items to their cart,\nleft the flow right before placing the order (the last step) ‚Äî the checkout page\n\nWe summed up the results to visually represent the emotional state of our in-app\nuser journey.Understand users‚Äô pain points üò©\nThe second step was to understand our users‚Äô pain points with the existing UX in\nthe checkout flow. To dig deeper into this, we reached out to our users directly\n(kudos to the research team for setting this up). We adapted both qualitative\nand quantitative methods to get to the root of every problem in the picture. We\nthen accumulated all our learnings into a consumer journey infographic.\n\nUser journey map | Courtesy: GoFood research team :)We wanted to involve the\nwhole GoFood team, beyond just research and design. This made it more\ncollaborative than the traditional sharing and feedback loop. To reinforce this,\nwe conducted several internal sharing and brainstorming sessions. The research\nteam also put together a fun quiz for user personas.\n\nInternal brainstorming sessions ‚Äî Researchers, Engineers, Designers, PMs & UX\nwriters.What were the results?\n\nAs anticipated, our users felt agitated, confused and overwhelmed, resulting in\na big drop off at the Checkout page. Here‚Äôs some of the feedback from our users:\n\n‚ÄúI find this step too confusing.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúA lot of times my order button is disabled (grey) and I don‚Äôt know why.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI often miss rechecking some information at this step, most times I only focus\non payment.‚Äù\n\nThis entire process was important for us ‚Äî to be able to go to the field, do\ninterviews, research, and speak to our customers directly. It gave us tremendous\ninsight into the product development, and is precisely what made our product so\ngood. This was not only fun but extremely useful.\n\nWith all the research and data at our disposal; we realised that redesigning the\ncheckout flow first will not only enhance the user experience, but help solve a\ncritical business problem.\n\n\nNeeds a lot of ‚ù§, doesn‚Äôt it?The original page consists of five components on one single page. It was\nextremely overwhelming for most of our users:\n\n 1. Dish Details and Notes card\n\n2. Delivery Location Selection card\n\n3. Payment Method Selection card\n\n4. Voucher card\n\n5. Billing & Discounts card\n\nHats off to our users for being patient. I say this because every time a user\nlands on this page, they had to process a verbose set of information, and\nperform countless actions in a single page to just ‚Äòconfirm‚Äô one food order.\nPainful. ?\n\nDesign is integral. Design is sacrosanct. While companies are now paying heed to\nthe importance of design, GOJEK, by virtue of being a #SuperApp, had to imbibe\ndesign logic into its very fabric.\n\nSo we got to work.\n\nDefining each problem ‚ö°Ô∏è\nOnce we dissected the users‚Äô goals and pain points, we had a clear picture of\nall the problems that plagued the Checkout flow. We narrowed our learnings to \nfive primary user problems to form a common understanding of what we were trying\nto solve.\n\nProblem 1: Verbose Information\nThe first thing most users did on this page was scroll, scroll and scroll. 3\nscrolls minimum. Also, did you notice the amount of text? We‚Äôre in the age of\nmicro-blogging and us millennials have the attention span of goldfishes, for\ncrying out loud!\n\nProblem 2: Cognitive overload\nThe page was overflowing with tasks that required explicit actions from the\nuser. Do this. And that. And hey, this too. Oh wait, THAT TOO. Chaotic. Select\ndelivery location but first find where it is, check the total, select payment\nmethod, glance through all the dishes added to the cart, apply your discount\nvoucher‚Ä¶.?\n\nProblem 3: Prolonged Checkout\nToo many actions and redundant information caused users to spend more than 2\nminutes just to confirm and place a simple order. Time wasted, energy wasted,\ntummy still not fed. üò´\n\nProblem 4: High Cancellations\nA large sum of our users hurried through this step without actually\ndouble-checking delivery location details (buried under a scroll somewhere).\nThis resulted in nearly 3% of our users cancelling and reordering the same cart\nwith an updated address (that‚Äôs another story in itself).\n\nProblem 5: Lacks Love\nThere was nothing delightful about this page. The dishes didn‚Äôt have images on\ncheckout, the icons weren‚Äôt consistent, and had too much clutter. It was just\ntext and buttons stacked in the form of black and white cards. No, seriously,\neven the active ‚ÄòAdd more items‚Äô button was a plain grey.\n\nIn a nutshell, our flow lacked information hierarchy, delight, structure, was\ntoo complex, and in all‚Ä¶ poor.\n\nIn order to fix this, we spent a month researching, ideating, and defining the\nproblem. Then we ideated some more, deliberated, chugged way too much beer (to\nadd some philosophical thinking), and tried to justify one solution after\nanother with the right data and metrics.\n\nWe were ready. We had all the answers. ?‚Äçü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è\n\n> Boy, were we wrong.\nIn the next post [http://bit.ly/2FUiYDo], I‚Äôll detail all the steps we took to\narrive at this perfect (lol) solution ‚Äî and how it all went downhill.\n\nWorking at GOJEK is an exercise in learning from experience. Sometimes, we find\nourselves confronted with undocumented and unsolved problems ‚Äî which are\nexpected when building a Super App. We could use a hand in solving these\nproblems though.

As we spread out from Jakarta,\nsatiating the hunger of millions of customers in most parts of Indonesia, GoFood\nas a product got increasingly complicated. Orders started to pile up, and we\nwere struggling to keep up with the skyrocketing demand. If we wanted to keep up\nwith users‚Äô expectations, a few things needed to be done. We had to change, and\nsimultaneously up our game.\n\nIt‚Äôs a VUCA world, and we often remind ourselves that not a lot of things are\nconstant. We‚Äôve been working hard to reimagine, re-engineer and redesign the\nGoFood flow which hasn‚Äôt been altered too much for many years.\n\nTo help you understand how it all started, let‚Äôs take you back in time a little\nbit‚Ä¶\n\nWhen the Gojek app for ride-hailing was launched in early 2015, we noticed there\nwere times when our driver partners had lean work periods. To provide additional\nmeans to help them make use of this time and earn more, GoSend (to send\ncouriers) and GoShop (to buy anything) were launched as auxiliary services.\n\n> We noticed that majority of orders placed in GoShop were for food. This gave way\nto GoFood, our dedicated food delivery product, launched in mid-2015.\nPhase 1: Listing Model\nGoFood started as a concierge model, where we had no tie-ups with restaurants. A\nSalesforce was deployed to list as many restaurant menus as possible on our\nplatform. When a customer placed an order, it would be assigned to one of our\ndriver partners, who would then go and place the order at the restaurant. The\ndriver partner would wait around, and when the order was ready, pay in cash,\npickup the order and deliver it to the customer.\n\nTedious? Yes. Scalable? No. ü§∑‚Äç\n\n\nPhase 2: Partnering With Merchants\nTo arrive at a scalable solution, we realised we had to take the restaurant\nmerchants along with us in this journey and welcome them into our ecosystem. We\nstarted partnering with the merchants, who were known as ‚ÄòGoFood Partners‚Äô.\n\n> This not only helped our merchants grow their businesses, but also got ample\nvisibility boost on GoFood.\nEven after onboarding them into our ecosystem, a large part of the process was\nmanual. It was far from ideal because there was no record of transactions\nbesides a booking on GoFood and a receipt handed to the driver partner.\n\nOften there were discrepancies in the number of orders assigned and the number\nof orders completed. How, you ask?\n\nImagine a GoFood partner who is part of a large chain of restaurants. When\nsomeone orders food from this chain, GoFood assigns this order to one outlet.\nHowever, the driver partner may decide to visit another outlet and pick up the\norder, as per convenience.\n\nThere were more problems galore.\n\nIf a merchant partner was not open for business on a particular day, and wanted\nto update their menu, or indicate items as out of stock, they had to call the\nGojek Customer Care. During this time, orders would still be coming in, which\nresulted in driver partners accepting orders that most certainly couldn‚Äôt be\ncompleted without a hassle.\n\nThere was a lot that needed fixing here, and it could only be done by\nintegrating merchants more deeply into our ecosystem. So, that‚Äôs exactly what we\ndid.\n\nPhase 3: The merchant app, GoResto\nTowards the end of 2016, a concept was developed for an app that would cater to\nmerchant partners, and by early 2017 GoResto (which is what we called it at the\ntime) was ready.\n\nWe introduced the following in GoResto:\n\n1. Electronic payments\nAll of Gojek‚Äôs driver partners had GoPay e-wallets associated with their\naccounts. With GoResto, we did the same for our GoFood partners. Transactions\nbetween driver and GoFood partners was directly wallet-to-wallet, hence,\ncashless.\n\n2. PIN exchange for restaurant verification\nTo ensure the order is secured, driver partners would also need to share a PIN\nwith the merchant while picking up the order. This electronic handshake helped\nus verify they were indeed picking up the right order from the right outlet.\n\n3. Catalog management\nWe noticed a lot of cancellations were happening because the items were either\nout of stock, restaurants were closed or customers were generally skeptical\nabout ordering dishes that didn‚Äôt have enough reference images. So, we started\nfocussing more on improving the product experience for our customers and BCR\n(booking completion rate). Catalog management was introduced so that the\nmerchants could regularly update details that customers saw on GoFood. For\nexample: Availability status of dishes that were put on the menu, uploading\ndetails pertaining to different items sold, etc.\n\nIn the meanwhile, GoResto was rebranded to GoBiz. What started off as a product\nthat helped merchants to manage their food orders, started evolving into\nsomething bigger. Since the scope extended beyond GoFood, calling it ‚ÄòGoResto‚Äô\nmade no sense.\n\nThe rebranding came with enhanced features in GoBiz. As you might‚Äôve guessed, it\nalso came with new, enhanced problems and a sub-optimal flow:\n\n‚ö†Ô∏è The driver partner was ready, but the food wasn‚Äôt\n> The average time taken for a driver partner was:\n~9 minutes to pick up an order\n~19 minutes to deliver the order\nA portion of this time was spent by the driver waiting for the food to be\nprepared, because in most cases, GoFood partners started preparing food only\nafter the driver arrived! This was mostly because customer would add more food\nitems or the ordered items would be out of stock. We figured that the driver\narrival time could be parallelised with the food prep time. This led to 2\nimportant things:\n\n * Overall delivery time for the customer could be reduced\n * Wait time for the driver could be utilised to fulfil other orders\n\nÔ∏èÔ∏èÔ∏è‚ö†Ô∏è GoFood Partner-driven cancellations existed, accountability didn‚Äôt\nGoFood partners had the ability to set their open hours and change item\navailability, but they didn‚Äôt always keep it updated.

This\nessentially means that the original order placed by the customer could be\nmodified due to various reasons: Incorrect listing of price, unavailability of\nitems, adding new items to the order, etc. To accommodate these cases, drivers\nwere allowed to input to final price of the order, leading to a price edit.\n\nAnd price edits aren‚Äôt uncommon.

This, too,\nhad to change.\n\nAfter brainstorming, mind-mapping and head-scratching, we arrived at Merchant\nAccept Flow (MAF). The merchants who are onboarded to MAF are called Super\nPartners. The solution lets our Super Partners accept/reject orders based on the\nrestaurant being open, availability of items, or any other factors that\ndetermine order fulfilment or cancellation. This in turn helps our customers and\ndriver partners know that the merchant is preparing food for sure, so that there\nare no customer or driver cancellations.\n\nIn Part-2 of this blog, we‚Äôll dive deep into Merchant Acceptance Flow, how we\nwent about designing it and introducing Super Partners to our customers.

As we spread out from Jakarta, satiating the hunger of millions of customers in most parts of Indonesia, GoFood as a product got increasingly complicated. Orders started to pile up, and we were struggling to keep up with the skyrocketing demand. If we wanted to keep up with users‚Äô expectations, a few things needed to be done. We had to change, and simultaneously up our game.</p><p>It‚Äôs a VUCA world, and we often remind ourselves that not a lot of things are constant. We‚Äôve been working hard to reimagine, re-engineer and redesign the GoFood flow which hasn‚Äôt been altered too much for many years.</p><p>To help you understand how it all started, let‚Äôs take you back in time a little bit‚Ä¶</p><p>When the Gojek app for ride-hailing was launched in early 2015, we noticed there were times when our driver partners had lean work periods. To provide additional means to help them make use of this time and earn more, GoSend (to send couriers) and GoShop (to buy anything) were launched as auxiliary services.</p><blockquote>We noticed that majority of orders placed in GoShop were for food. This gave way to GoFood, our dedicated food delivery product, launched in mid-2015.</blockquote><h3 id=\"phase-1-listing-model\">Phase 1: Listing Model</h3><p>GoFood started as a concierge model, where we had no tie-ups with restaurants. A Salesforce was deployed to list as many restaurant menus as possible on our platform. When a customer placed an order, it would be assigned to one of our driver partners, who would then go and place the order at the restaurant. The driver partner would wait around, and when the order was ready, pay in cash, pickup the order and deliver it to the customer.</p><h3 id=\"tedious-yes-scalable-no-\"><em>Tedious? Yes. Scalable? No. ü§∑‚Äç</em></h3><p></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://gojek-ghost.zysk.in/content/images/2020/06/image-16.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><h3 id=\"phase-2-partnering-with-merchants\">Phase 2: Partnering With Merchants</h3><p>To arrive at a scalable solution, we realised we had to take the restaurant merchants along with us in this journey and welcome them into our ecosystem. We started partnering with the merchants, who were known as ‚Äò<strong><em>GoFood Partners</em></strong>‚Äô.</p><blockquote>This not only helped our merchants grow their businesses, but also got ample visibility boost on GoFood.</blockquote><p>Even after onboarding them into our ecosystem, a large part of the process was manual. It was far from ideal because there was no record of transactions besides a booking on GoFood and a receipt handed to the driver partner.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://gojek-ghost.zysk.in/content/images/2020/06/image-17.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>Often there were discrepancies in the number of orders assigned and the number of orders completed. How, you ask?</p><p>Imagine a GoFood partner who is part of a large chain of restaurants. When someone orders food from this chain, GoFood assigns this order to one outlet. However, the driver partner may decide to visit another outlet and pick up the order, as per convenience.</p><h3 id=\"there-were-more-problems-galore-\"><em>There were more problems galore.</em><br></h3><p>If a merchant partner was not open for business on a particular day, and wanted to update their menu, or indicate items as out of stock, they had to call the Gojek Customer Care. During this time, orders would still be coming in, which resulted in driver partners accepting orders that most certainly couldn‚Äôt be completed without a hassle.</p><p>There was a lot that needed fixing here, and it could only be done by integrating merchants more deeply into our ecosystem. So, that‚Äôs exactly what we did.</p><h3 id=\"phase-3-the-merchant-app-goresto\">Phase 3: The merchant app, GoResto</h3><p>Towards the end of 2016, a concept was developed for an app that would cater to merchant partners, and by early 2017 GoResto (which is what we called it at the time) was ready.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://gojek-ghost.zysk.in/content/images/2020/06/image-18.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>We introduced the following in GoResto:</p><h4 id=\"1-electronic-payments\">1.

How do such diverse people come together and build\namazing things? That‚Äôs where Program Management comes into the picture.\n\nThe Challenge\nGoMerchants PDG was formed from five separate teams (SPOTS, Midtrans, Mapan,\nGoResto, Nadipos), and each team had a unique engineering culture. Across teams,\nthe total number of staff involved in cross-functional work was ~240 people.\n\nAfter a discovery phase of the process over 3 months with the various groups, we\nfound that every team was utilising different versions of project management\nmethodology and tools to track team progress. Across various teams, we\nidentified nearly a dozen different types of tools and methods including the\nScrum method, Kanban method, Jira tools, Favro Tools, and Trello tools.\n\nThe key takeaway was clear: There was no single source of truth for tracking\nteam deployment progress.\n\nThe Solution\nTo achieve our goal of reaching a high rate of (quality) deliverables with clear\ntransparency on progress, the Program Managers decided to build a program that\nset a single standard workflow for everyone involved.

The factors in selecting Jira were the platform functionality\nis highly-configurable to the specific requirements of a team, as well, as it\nhas the flexibility to allow for usage in a wide variety of environments and\nprocesses.\n\nScrum Activities\nBelow is the flow of scrum activity. It starts from Pre-Iteration Planning\nMeeting (Pre-IPM), Retrospective, IPM/Sprint Planning, and Daily Standup:\n\nSprints\nA Sprint is a time-box of iterations, where the releasable works that align with\nsprint goals are implemented. A Sprint always has a fixed start and end date ‚Äî\nthese dates should be of the same duration; typically two weeks.\n\nSource: Essential Scrum: A Practical Guide to the Most Popular Agile Process\nSprints notes: While most of GoMerchants PDG uses two-week sprints, the length\nof time can depend on several factors like the final deadline, number of people\nin the team, and holidays in the calendar. Some teams use a one-week Sprint\ncycle due to urgent work that requires moving at an accelerated pace. But,\ngenerally it is not a best practice to use one-week sprint cycles as team\nachievement moments can be missed, quality could be sacrificed, and team\nburn-out is a real risk.\n\nPre-I.P.M. (Pre-Iteration Planning Meeting)\nPre-IPM is an activity to review the active Sprint and manage backlog and Sprint\ngoal(s) for the next iteration. Pre-IPM is attended by a Product Manager, Tech\nLeads, and Program Manager. The Product Manager should write-up the ‚Äòstory‚Äô aka\nplan, in Jira after Pre-IPM. Tech lead should advise if the story and goals for\nthe next iteration are technically achievable.\n\nAs a Program Manager, you can use spreadsheets for mapping between the story and\nteam before doing the IPM. Below is the example:\n\nPre-IPM notes: This is basically a small meeting with a PM, TechLead, HoE/HoP\n(if necessary) and PgM. The purpose is to finalise the work backlog for the team\nin the upcoming Sprint. This meeting will help streamline the Sprint Planning\nmeeting by confirming that the final requirements have been aligned by all\nstakeholders ‚Äî the goal being to reduce the number of ‚ÄúRequirement Changes‚Äù\ngoing forward. .\n\nRetrospective\nThe purpose of a retrospective in IPM is to collect previous sprint feedback\nfrom the team. It contains some columns like:\n\n * Glad: What makes you happy in this sprint or things that went well\n * Sad: What makes you sad in this sprint and from here we can see how we can\n   improve it\n * Mad: What makes you mad or frustrated in this sprint\n * Ideas: Idea to improve our next sprint\n * Appreciation: Appreciation in this sprint, esp if there‚Äôs a pretty big team\n   achievement\n * Action Item: Action item to improve our next sprint based on Sad, Mad, and\n   Ideas columns. This is the important part to be followed up so ‚Äúlesson\n   learned‚Äù value from every sprint is really working\n\nWe can use several tools to help us collect data, i.e. https://funretro.io/,\nbelow is the example:\n\nSend a retrospective link to a Slack channel before IPM and encourage the team\nto fill the cards. Do the retrospective by talking through each column 15‚Äì30\nminutes before IPM starts.\n\nRetrospective notes: This session provides the opportunity for a team to look\nback and see how they can improve. Retrospectives can be a catalyst for\norganisational change, team change or even a culture change. The Retrospective\ncan be a place to build and enable teams, or to help teams start their journey\nwith a clear understanding of where to go next. It‚Äôs a method that is very\nuseful to gauge the Team Happiness state and gain Improvement Feedback from the\nteam. A Retrospective also builds trust and helps make the team grow stronger as\nindividual members know they have an outlet to express their feedback and they\nwill be heard by their managers and colleagues. Since this process is highly\nactionable, the PgM‚Äôs have incorporated it beyond the use case of small teams,\nand have instituted it at larger scale for the entire GoMerchants PDG Org every\n6 months.\n\nIPM/Sprint Planning\nIPM/Sprint Planning is an activity that is attended by all members of the team\nto prioritise the backlog, discuss stories, and determine story points.\n\nSource: http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1928232Below are the\nsteps taken in an IPM:\n\nBefore IPM:\n\n * Program Manager sends a retrospective link to a Slack channel\n\nDuring IPM:\n\n * Retrospective 15 min\n * Open Sprint Report to review active sprint (Done and Not Done)\n * Complete Sprint\n * Open velocity chart to review the commitment and complete stories from the\n   previous Sprint\n * Ask the team who will take a leave and discuss with PM about achievement\n   story (this will be helpful to adjust velocity for the next Sprint)\n * The PM explains each story for a new sprint. Make sure there‚Äôs always a DoD\n   and add story points\n * Add the Sprint Goal\n * Start Sprint\n * After IPM\n * Collect result of retrospective, make sure action items are done/started to\n   be worked on\n\nDaily Standup\nStand up Preparation:\n\n * Set a daily schedule (max 15 mins) and make sure the team is committed to\n   attend stand up\n * Remind the team to update Jira 10‚Äì30 mins before stand up\n\nDuring Stand up\n\n * Open Jira dashboard to review story update and movement.\n * Create a set of Standup Notes and copy it in the team Slack channel if\n   necessary\n * Ask these questions and record the answer to each member: What did I\n   accomplish since the last daily standup? What obstacles are impeding my\n   progress? What will I do by the next daily standup?\n * Daily Stand up notes: There are times people will forget to update Jira\n   ticket (it‚Äôs a never-ending challenge üíÅ). As a Program Manager, we need to\n   remind/ensure their team updates Jira (at least) right beforethe stand up\n   starts.\n\nThe Results\nWe‚Äôll let them speak for themselves!\n\nH1 & H2 2019 resultAfter building a standard approach across teams using Agile,\nJira, and other tool sets, the Program Management approach used by the\nGoMerchants PgM team to combine these elements helped to vastly improve the\neffectiveness of team performance on 2019 period.

The new matchmaking codebase was\nbuilt in two days and could handle about 700 drivers. It was all manual and\nsomething had to be done to automate\n[https://blog.gojekengineering.com/how-we-do-what-we-do-at-go-jek-tech-d1d5d952e13] \nthe whole process.\n\nIn the beginning of 2015, a version of the app was launched to keep pace with\nincreasing demand.
