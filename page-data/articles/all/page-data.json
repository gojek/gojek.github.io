Voila!! You got a driver. That was\nfast. You can see your driver’s location on the map, and the estimated time they\nwould take to come to you.\n\nBut hang on… It seems like the map is a bit messed up.\n\nThe driver location on the map goes back and forth at unreal speed, and even\nflies over buildings. Starring in an action movie is not exactly how you want to\nstart your week. 😮\n\nWhile our driver-partners sure are superman in their own unique way, they\ncertainly can’t drive over buildings. This is clearly not how your driver is\nactually driving on the road. But then why is the map showing all this?\n\nWell, there are multiple factors that can lead to a bad experience like that.\nSome within our control, some not so much (as of now). We decided to go back to\nthe drawing board and figure out the issues that are in our control and fix them\nfor good. And that is how we built a world-class (arguably 😬) live-tracking\nexperience.\n\nBut what is live-tracking, you would ask?\n\nLive tracking is a complete map experience. It doesn’t involve anything other\nthan what you see on maps after you get a driver.\n\nSo, what do you see on maps?\n\n 1. Driver's location depicted by a green marker.\n 2. The routes.\n 3. The change in driver marker as the driver moves closer to your pickup/your\n    destination.\n 4. The change in route as the driver moves.\n\nAnd that’s it. That’s all live-tracking is.\n\n> But that sounds quite simple. Right? Use some routing APIs and plot the markers\nand routes.\nWell, yes, it sounded easy to us when we first heard about it too. The real\nexperience threw us a few curveballs. Let’s go through how we create a\nlive-tracking experience.\n\nInput\nLet’s look at the input data that we need to create a live-tracking animation:\n\nDriver Location and Routes\nOur driver apps have an in-built mechanism to upload driver location to our\nbackend at regular intervals. This is how we are able to find a driver close to\nyour location when you order one of our services. The primary input to\nlive-tracking is this driver location.\n\nIn our driver app, we get this location using Android’s FusedLocationProvider \nAPI which automatically uses the best location provider(GPS, Wifi, etc). The\ndriver location is ingested into our backend system via a continuous stream.\nRoutes are generated by our internal routing engine and provided to the customer\napp.\n\nInput Source\nAs you would have guessed, this data is provided via API calls initiated by the\nour Super App to the routing engine.\n\nMaking the API call just once won’t be sufficient. Right? The app needs to be\ninformed every time the driver’s location has changed. So, the customer app\npolls this API every few seconds to get this data.\n\nNow, we have a continuous stream of data flowing to our app which has all the\ninformation that we need to show the vehicle animation on the road.\n\nTerminology\nBefore moving forward, we should get acquainted with a few terminologies that we\nwould use quite frequently in this post.\n\n 1. Route: The entire list of latitude-longitudes between the driver location to\n    the pickup/destination location.\n 2. Segment: A segment is the smallest unit of a route. It is a straight line\n    from one position in the routes list to the very next position in the routes\n    list.\n\nA route of length n has n-1 segments. Confused? Yeah, let’s take an example.\n\nA Route looks like this:\n\n[{-62441198, 106.8032959},\n{-6.2440766, 106.80328}, \n{-6.2439977, 106.8033275},\n{-6.2434893, 106.8029214},\n{-6.2433926, 106.8030539},\n{-6.2436018, 106.803222}]\n\nThere are 5 Segments in this route.\n\nSegment 1: {-6.2441198, 106.8032959,-6.2440766, 106.80328}\nSegment 2: {-6.2440766, 106.80328,-6.2439977, 106.8033275}\nSegment 3: {-6.2439977, 106.8033275,-6.2434893, 106.8029214}\nSegment 4: {-6.2434893, 106.8029214,-6.2433926, 106.8030539}\nSegment 5: {-6.2433926, 106.8030539,-6.2436018, 106.8032224}\n\nThe initial setup\nWhen the user lands on the live tracking screen, the app immediately makes a\ncall to our internal API to get the driver location and route. Once we get this\ndata, we plot it on the map using the standard GoogleMap methods. \ngoogleMap.addMarker(), googleMap.addPolyline() etc.\n\nSometimes, we don’t have the routing information available immediately, so we\njust show the driver marker. We also store this data locally in an in-memory\ncache as we would need it later to do some comparisons.\n\nSo, the customer is able to see the markers and routes on the map now. So far so\ngood.\n\nThe subsequent updates\nAs I mentioned earlier, we need to change the position of driver marker and\nroute as the driver moves. The customer app makes a call to the same internal\nAPI every few seconds. After the first response, we don’t move any markers or\nroutes on the map until the next response succeeds.\n\nIn the next response, we again get the same data points i.e the route and driver\nlocation but with different values, of course, if the driver has moved. The next\nset of data that we get can have the following characteristics:\n\n 1. Route and driver location don’t change\n 2. Route changes\n 3. Route doesn’t change BUT driver location does\n\nLet’s discuss these cases one by one.\n\n1: Route and driver location don’t change\nIf nothing has changed, we don’t need to do anything. Probably our driver\npartner is stuck in traffic. 😞\n\n2: Route changes\nThis can happen either when:\n\n 1. The app was not showing any route to the user before i.e the first response\n    didn’t have the route.\n 2. The app was showing a route that is different from the newly received route.\n    This usually happens in cases where the driver starts following a different\n    route from the one they were following before. This can also happen due to\n    road closures or simply because our driver-partner initially followed a\n    wrong route by mistake 😅.\n\nIn either of these cases, we simply ignore the old driver marker and routes\nwhich were shown and plot the new marker and routes.\n\n3: Route doesn’t change BUT driver location does\nThe app was showing the same route to the user before i.e the old response had\nthe same route as the new response. This means that the driver is following the\noriginal route that we determined.\n\nIn this case, we need to animate the driver marker on the map from the old\nlocation to the new location along the same route. This is the most common\nscenario, which can again be broken down further into multiple scenarios (yeah,\nI’m all about breaking things down 🤐).\n\n3.1: Does the new location lie on the route?\nTo animate the driver marker from it’s current position to the new location, we\nfirst need to know whether the new location lies on the route or not.\n\nYeah, we can’t be sure that the driver location that we have received would\nalways lie on the route/road because of various GPS inaccuracy issues.\n\nWe iterate through every segment in the route to find the segment which has the\nnew location. For every segment, we use the Geometry/PolyUtil library to\ndetermine whether the driver location lies on that route.\n\nWe also specify a tolerance of a few meters to account for GPS inaccuracy. So,\nif the newly received location is within a radius of X meters near a segment,\nthis method will return true.\n\nAndroid\n\nboolean isLocationOnPath(LatLng point,List<LatLng> polyline,boolean geodesic,\ndouble tolerance)\n\niOS\n\nBOOL GMSGeometryIsLocationOnPathToleranc\n[https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios-sdk/reference/group___geometry_utils#ga580ba381b9d4fbc0ff430cf69e06e66d]\ne(CLLocationCoordinate2D point,GMSPath\n[https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios-sdk/reference/interface_g_m_s_path] \n* path,BOOL geodesic,CLLocationDistance tolerance)\n\nIf the location doesn’t lie on any of the segments in the route, we are sad and\nso, we don’t animate anything. But if it does, we go forward with the next step\nwhich is….\n\n3.2: Vehicle projection on route\nWhen we receive a new location, the start location is simply the position that\nthe driver marker is already at. No logic required there to calculate that.\n\nThe end location should simply be the new location that we received. Well, in an\nideal world, it should be but we live so far away from an ideal world 😞.\n\nAs we mentioned earlier, the raw driver location that we get from the driver app\nvia GPS/other providers mostly doesn’t lie on the road. So, we have to find a\nprojection of the driver location on the road/route.\n\nIf you have been reading carefully, you might wonder why we can’t just use the \nisLocationOnPath() method above 🤔.\n\nWell, if you had been reading more carefully, you might have noticed that this\nmethod returns a boolean explaining whether the location is on/near the route or\nnot 🤦‍♂. It doesn’t return the projected location. (Ohh..if someone from Maps\nUtils stumbled upon this by chance, please add that method, good sir).\n\nSo, we had to revise some maths. Yeah, folks, learn your maths well. You never\nknow when a situation like this might arise 🤷‍♂.\n\n“Find the projection of point (x,y) on the line y = mx + c”. Does that ring a\nbell? Drawing a perpendicular line towards the segment and calculating the\nlocation of where the line and route intersect can give us the projected\nlocation. Right?\n\nWell, the above approach works for 2-D systems but earth is not a 2-D space. We\nneed a way to project the spherical surface of the earth onto a rectangle 2-D\nspace. There are several ways to do that. All of them have certain drawbacks. We\nmight lose information like direction or the shape of landmasses/countries or\nthe area information.\n\nMercator Projection\n\nMercator projection is one of the available methods to project the spherical map\nof earth onto a rectangle to make usable maps. Most of the mapping tools used\nfor navigation use this projection.\n\nThe key feature of Mercator projection is that it retains the direction\ninformation. That means if point A is 30deg east from north of point B on the\nglobe, it will be in the same direction on its Mercator projection. Or say there\nis a turn of 90deg in some lane, it will be 90deg on Mercator projection as\nwell. That is the reason it works really well for navigation purposes.\n\nHow to use a Mercator projection?\n\n 1. Every point on the earth is projected on a cylinder exactly like point A\n    which has point A’ on the cylinder.\n 2. Once all the required points/routes are projected on this cylinder. It is\n    unrolled, and we obtain a rectangle like the one shown above.\n 3. All the planar geometry can be applied with a very little margin of error on\n    this 2D projected map.\n 4. After processing all the points/routes they can be converted back to\n    latitude and longitude on the globe.\n\nSo, now we have the projected driver location on the route which we will fondly\ncall snapped point going forward.\n\n3.3: End-to-End animation\nThe new driver location that we receive can be present in any segment. It may be\nthat it is in the same segment or it may be that it is on the next segment or on\nthe next one or it may be that it is on the last segment.\n\nBut for linear animation, we need a start point and an end point. The start\npoint is the current position of the driver marker. We already got the snapped\nendpoint in the earlier section. But we can’t just animate from start to end at\nonce as that would seem like the car is flying and ignoring U-turns, routes,\netc. So, how do we prevent it from flying?\n\nWhat do you do when you can’t fly to a place? You follow the road. Right? That’s\nwhat we have to do as well. Make the driver marker follow the route/road. We\nneed to animate along each segment in the route until we reach the segment which\nhas the driver position that we received.\n\nThere are again two cases here 😜:\n\n3.3.1: The new driver location is on the same segment\nIn this case, we can directly animate from the current position of driver marker\nto the driver location that we received since this is just a straight line\nanimation.\n\nA segment is always a straight line. We will discuss more on how to do the\nanimation b/w 2 points in a later section.\n\n3.3.2: The new driver location is on a different segment\nIn this case, we need to animate to that segment along the route. We have to\nanimate along each of the segments in between to reach the final segment.\n\nFor animation along the first segment, we set the endpoint of the animation to\nthe beginning of the next segment in the route. We animate to the end of the\nfirst segment.\n\nThe next segment may also not have the driver location that we received. After a\ndriver has traversed the first segment, we move the end location of the\nanimation to the end of the next segment, and so on and so forth till we reach\nthe last segment. Confusing, ya? Let’s see an example.\n\nSo much zig-zag (huh!!)The car icon(A) represents the location in the segment\nwhere the driver marker currently is. The red pin(X) represents the new snapped\nlocation received.\n\nIn the 1st animation, we move the driver marker from A to the end of the first\nsegment (B).\n\nIn the 2nd animation, the driver marker is moved through the entire length of\nthe 2nd segment.\n\nAnd so on and so forth till we reach the segment which has the newly received\nsnapped location (X).\n\nAnimation in a segment\nWe now know how the overall animation would look like. But we also need to\nconfigure how the smallest unit of the animation i.e animation in a segment\nshould happen.\n\nStart point and End point: For case #1 above, the animation in a segment will\nhappen just once. For case #2 above, this animation in a segment will happen\nmultiple times. Start and endpoints will be determined before beginning each of\nthe animations.\n\nBearing b/w these two points: Bearing can be calculated using another one of\nGeometry/Maps Utils method.\n\nSphericalUtil.computeHeading(startPosition, endPosition)\n\nDuration of animation: Calculating duration is a bit tricky. And the duration is\nthe most important thing in any animation. Sometimes the difference b/w a smooth\nand a choppy animation is caused by the duration. It was very important that we\ngot it right. So, let’s take a break and see how to calculate the duration.\n\nWhat is Duration?\nIt’s the amount of time for which the animation should happen. But you already\nknow that. Going back to middle school maths (yeah, that far), how do you\ncalculate time? Time is nothing but distance divided by speed. Correct?\nCalculating straight line distance b/w the two points we want to animate through\nis pretty easy.\n\nSphericalUtil.computeDistanceBetween(startLocation, endLocation)\n\nCool, cool. But what about speed? How should we calculate speed?\n\nSpeed calculation\nFusedLocationProvider API in the driver app does provide the speed of the\nvehicle but it’s highly unreliable. So, we have to employ some tricks to\ncalculate the speed.\n\nSpeed is distance divided by time. Distance again!! Seems like we are running in\ncircles 😵. Not exactly. Here the distance is not the straight line distance b/w\nthe two points that we have to animate through.\n\nThis is the total distance along the route from the segment that the old driver\nlocation is currently located at, to the segment where the new driver location\nis. Yeah, that statement is a bit confusing. So, let’s take an example.\n\nThe car icon(A) represents the location in the segment where the driver marker\ncurrently is. The red pin(X) represents the new snapped location received. To\ncalculate the distance, we do the obvious:\n\nTotal distance = d1 + d2 + d3 + d4\n\nNow, we have the distance. We need the time interval.\n\nThe FusedLocationProvider API in the driver app does provide us the timestamp at\nwhich a location was updated. And this information is passed to our backend and\nsubsequently to the customer app.\n\nWe calculate the time difference b/w the old driver location and the new driver\nlocation using their timestamps. Wait, how do we know the old driver location?\nAs we had mentioned earlier, we cache the last available driver location and\nroute in an in-memory cache.\n\nTotal route distance divided by time and now we have the speed for the entire\nduration. Linear distance divided by this speed and now we have the durationfor\na single animation in a segment. Cool, so let’s get back to the point where we\nbroke off 😅.\n\nUpdate the animation\nWith all the above information, we start the animation. But wait? Aren’t we\nmissing something? We did start an animation b/w two points but how will our\nanimator know how to animate?\n\nAnimation is just a bunch of frame updates that happen every fast. How do we\nupdate the marker position, the starting point of the route, the rotation in\neach and every frame of the animation? Well, the mobile/web framework allows us\nto do something every time the frame is updated.\n\nBut what is this something that we should do?\n\n1. Update marker’s position\nFor markers, we need to update their position. Once we have the position, we can\nsimply update the marker position using the marker.setPosition(). To find the\nposition during each frame of the animation, we need the percentage of animation\nthat has elapsed.\n\nWe can get the percentage from the Animation framework. Using this percentage\nand the start and end position, we calculate the intermediate position/s like\nthis:\n\nSphericalUtil.interpolate(startPosition, endPosition, fraction)\n\n2. Update Routes\nRoutes need to be aligned with the marker’s movement. So, we update the routes\nas well using the values above and updating the polyline points of that route\nusing the polyline.setPoints().\n\nAnd that’s a wrap. The result that we get is a very smooth, measured movement of\nthe vehicle along the road.\n\nThere are a few more tips/tricks that we employ to ensure that there are no\nabrupt changes in the animation.\n\nBut that’s for next time. 😃\n\nWhat’s next?\nWe still need to go a long way to meet the standards that we have set for\nourselves. Currently, this new experience is only rolled out to GoRide, GoCar,\nand GoBluebird. We are working on bringing the same experience to other services\nlike GoFood, GoSend, and GoShop.

Voila!! You got a driver. That was fast. You can see your driver’s location on the map, and the estimated time they would take to come to you.</p><p><em><em>But hang on… It seems like the map is a bit messed up.</em></em></p><p>The driver location on the map goes back and forth at unreal speed, and even flies over buildings. Starring in an action movie is not exactly how you want to start your week. 😮</p><p>While our driver-partners sure are superman in their own unique way, they certainly can’t drive over buildings. This is clearly not how your driver is actually driving on the road. But then why is the map showing all this?</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://gojek-ghost.zysk.in/content/images/2020/05/LiveTracking2.gif\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>Well, there are multiple factors that can lead to a bad experience like that. Some within our control, some not so much (as of now). We decided to go back to the drawing board and figure out the issues that are in our control and fix them for good. And that is how we built a world-class (arguably 😬) live-tracking experience.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://gojek-ghost.zysk.in/content/images/2020/05/image.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>But what is live-tracking, you would ask?</p><p>Live tracking is a complete map experience. It doesn’t involve anything other than what you see on maps after you get a driver.</p><p>So, what do you see on maps?</p><ol><li>Driver's location depicted by a green marker.</li><li>The routes.</li><li>The change in driver marker as the driver moves closer to your pickup/your destination.</li><li>The change in route as the driver moves.</li></ol><p>And that’s it. That’s all live-tracking is.</p><blockquote><em><em>But that sounds quite simple. Right? Use some routing APIs and plot the markers and routes.</em></em></blockquote><p>Well, yes, it sounded easy to us when we first heard about it too. The real experience threw us a few curveballs. Let’s go through how we create a live-tracking experience.</p><h3 id=\"input\">Input</h3><p>Let’s look at the input data that we need to create a live-tracking animation:</p><h3 id=\"driver-location-and-routes\">Driver Location and Routes</h3><p>Our driver apps have an in-built mechanism to upload driver location to our backend at regular intervals. This is how we are able to find a driver close to your location when you order one of our services. The primary input to live-tracking is this driver location.</p><p>In our driver app, we get this location using Android’s <code>FusedLocationProvider</code> API which automatically uses the best location provider(GPS, Wifi, etc). The driver location is ingested into our backend system via a continuous stream. Routes are generated by our internal routing engine and provided to the customer app.</p><h3 id=\"input-source\">Input Source</h3><p>As you would have guessed, this data is provided via API calls initiated by the our Super App to the routing engine.</p><p>Making the API call just once won’t be sufficient. Right? The app needs to be informed every time the driver’s location has changed. So, the customer app polls this API every few seconds to get this data.</p><p>Now, we have a continuous stream of data flowing to our app which has all the information that we need to show the vehicle animation on the road.</p><h3 id=\"terminology\">Terminology</h3><p>Before moving forward, we should get acquainted with a few terminologies that we would use quite frequently in this post.</p><ol><li><strong><strong>Route</strong></strong>: The entire list of latitude-longitudes between the driver location to the pickup/destination location.</li><li><strong><strong>Segment</strong></strong>: A segment is the smallest unit of a route. It is a straight line from one position in the routes list to the very next position in the routes list.</li></ol><p>A route of length n has n-1 segments. Confused? Yeah, let’s take an example.</p><p>A <strong><strong>Route</strong></strong> looks like this:</p><p>[{-6<code>2441198, 106.8032959},<br>{-6.2440766, 106.80328}, <br>{-6.2439977, 106.8033275},<br>{-6.2434893, 106.8029214},<br>{-6.2433926, 106.8030539},<br>{-6.2436018, 106.803222}]</code></p><p>There are 5 <strong><strong>Segments</strong></strong> in this route.</p><p><code>Segment 1: {-6.2441198, 106.8032959,-6.2440766, 106.80328}</code><br><code>Segment 2: {-6.2440766, 106.80328,-6.2439977, 106.8033275}</code><br><code>Segment 3: {-6.2439977, 106.8033275,-6.2434893, 106.8029214}</code><br><code>Segment 4: {-6.2434893, 106.8029214,-6.2433926, 106.8030539}</code><br><code>Segment 5: {-6.2433926, 106.8030539,-6.2436018, 106.8032224}</code></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://gojek-ghost.zysk.in/content/images/2020/05/image-1.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><h3 id=\"the-initial-setup\">The initial setup</h3><p>When the user lands on the live tracking screen, the app immediately makes a call to our internal API to get the driver location and route. Once we get this data, we plot it on the map using the standard GoogleMap methods. <code><em><em>googleMap.addMarker()</em></em></code><em><em>, </em></em><code><em><em>googleMap.addPolyline()</em></em></code> etc.</p><p>Sometimes, we don’t have the routing information available immediately, so we just show the driver marker. We also store this data locally in an in-memory cache as we would need it later to do some comparisons.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/436/1*k9IpgQ4ss-bhKHBY5ETUgg.gif\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>So, the customer is able to see the markers and routes on the map now. So far so good.</p><h3 id=\"the-subsequent-updates\">The subsequent updates</h3><p>As I mentioned earlier, we need to change the position of driver marker and route as the driver moves. The customer app makes a call to the same internal API every few seconds. After the first response, we don’t move any markers or routes on the map until the next response succeeds.</p><p>In the next response, we again get the same data points i.e the route and driver location but with different values, of course, <strong><strong>if the driver has moved</strong></strong>. The next set of data that we get can have the following characteristics:</p><ol><li>Route and driver location don’t change</li><li>Route changes</li><li>Route doesn’t change BUT driver location does</li></ol><p>Let’s discuss these cases one by one.</p><h3 id=\"1-route-and-driver-location-don-t-change\">1: Route and driver location don’t change</h3><p>If nothing has changed, we don’t need to do anything. Probably our driver partner is stuck in traffic. 😞</p><h3 id=\"2-route-changes\">2: Route changes</h3><p>This can happen either when:</p><ol><li>The app was not showing any route to the user before i.e the first response didn’t have the route.</li><li>The app was showing a route that is different from the newly received route. This usually happens in cases where the driver starts following a different route from the one they were following before. This can also happen due to road closures or simply because our driver-partner initially followed a wrong route by mistake 😅.</li></ol><p>In either of these cases, we simply ignore the old driver marker and routes which were shown and plot the new marker and routes.</p><h3 id=\"3-route-doesn-t-change-but-driver-location-does\">3: Route doesn’t change BUT driver location does</h3><p>The app was showing the same route to the user before i.e the old response had the same route as the new response. This means that the driver is following the original route that we determined.</p><p>In this case, we need to animate the driver marker on the map from the old location to the new location along the same route. This is the most common scenario, which can again be broken down further into multiple scenarios (yeah, I’m all about breaking things down 🤐).</p><h3 id=\"3-1-does-the-new-location-lie-on-the-route\">3.1: Does the new location lie on the route?</h3><p>To animate the driver marker from it’s current position to the new location, we first need to know whether the new location lies on the route or not.</p><p>Yeah, we can’t be sure that the driver location that we have received would always lie on the route/road because of various GPS inaccuracy issues.</p><p>We iterate through every segment in the route to find the segment which has the new location. For every segment, we use the Geometry/PolyUtil library to determine whether the driver location lies on that route.</p><p>We also specify a tolerance of a few meters to account for GPS inaccuracy. So, if the newly received location is within a radius of <strong><strong>X meters</strong></strong> near a segment, this method will return true.</p><p><strong><strong>Android</strong></strong></p><p><code>boolean isLocationOnPath(LatLng point,List&lt;LatLng&gt; polyline,boolean geodesic, double tolerance)</code></p><p><strong><strong>iOS</strong></strong></p><p><code>BOOL <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios-sdk/reference/group___geometry_utils#ga580ba381b9d4fbc0ff430cf69e06e66d\" rel=\"noopener\">GMSGeometryIsLocationOnPathToleranc</a>e(CLLocationCoordinate2D point,<a href=\"https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios-sdk/reference/interface_g_m_s_path\" rel=\"noopener\">GMSPath</a> * path,BOOL geodesic,CLLocationDistance tolerance)</code></p><p>If the location doesn’t lie on any of the segments in the route, we are sad and so, we don’t animate anything. But if it does, we go forward with the next step which is….</p><h3 id=\"3-2-vehicle-projection-on-route\">3.2: Vehicle projection on route</h3><p>When we receive a new location, the start location is simply the position that the driver marker is already at. No logic required there to calculate that.</p><p>The end location should simply be the new location that we received. Well, in an ideal world, it <strong><strong>should be</strong></strong> but we live so far away from an ideal world 😞.</p><p>As we mentioned earlier, the raw driver location that we get from the driver app via GPS/other providers mostly doesn’t lie on the road. So, we have to find a projection of the driver location on the road/route.</p><p>If you have been reading carefully, you might wonder why we can’t just use the <em><em>isLocationOnPath()</em></em> method above 🤔.</p><p>Well, if you had been reading <em><em>more</em></em> carefully, you might have noticed that this method returns a boolean explaining whether the location is on/near the route or not 🤦‍♂. It doesn’t return the projected location. (Ohh..if someone from Maps Utils stumbled upon this by chance, please add that method, good sir).</p><p>So, we had to revise some maths. Yeah, folks, learn your maths well. You never know when a situation like this might arise 🤷‍♂.</p><p><em><em>“Find the projection of point (x,y) on the line y = mx + c”.</em></em> Does that ring a bell? Drawing a perpendicular line towards the segment and calculating the location of where the line and route intersect can give us the projected location. Right?</p><p>Well, the above approach works for 2-D systems but earth is not a 2-D space. We need a way to project the spherical surface of the earth onto a rectangle 2-D space. There are several ways to do that. All of them have certain drawbacks. We might lose information like direction or the shape of landmasses/countries or the area information.</p><p><strong><strong>Mercator Projection</strong></strong></p><p>Mercator projection is one of the available methods to project the spherical map of earth onto a rectangle to make usable maps. Most of the mapping tools used for navigation use this projection.</p><p>The key feature of Mercator projection is that it retains the direction information. That means if point A is 30deg east from north of point B on the globe, it will be in the same direction on its Mercator projection. Or say there is a turn of 90deg in some lane, it will be 90deg on Mercator projection as well. That is the reason it works really well for navigation purposes.</p><p><strong><strong>How to use a Mercator projection?</strong></strong></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://gojek-ghost.zysk.in/content/images/2020/05/image-4.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://gojek-ghost.zysk.in/content/images/2020/05/image-5.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><ol><li>Every point on the earth is projected on a cylinder exactly like point A which has point A’ on the cylinder.</li><li>Once all the required points/routes are projected on this cylinder. It is unrolled, and we obtain a rectangle like the one shown above.</li><li>All the planar geometry can be applied with a very little margin of error on this 2D projected map.</li><li>After processing all the points/routes they can be converted back to latitude and longitude on the globe.</li></ol><p>So, now we have the projected driver location on the route which we will fondly call <code>snapped point</code> going forward.</p><h3 id=\"3-3-end-to-end-animation\">3.3: End-to-End animation</h3><p>The new driver location that we receive can be present in <strong><strong>any</strong></strong> segment. It may be that it is in the same segment or it may be that it is on the next segment or on the next one or it may be that it is on the last segment.</p><p>But for linear animation, we need a start point and an end point. The start point is the current position of the driver marker. We already got the snapped endpoint in the earlier section. But we can’t just animate from start to end <strong><strong>at once</strong></strong> as that would seem like the car is flying and ignoring U-turns, routes, etc. So, how do we prevent it from flying?</p><p>What do you do when you can’t fly to a place? You follow the road. Right? That’s what we have to do as well. Make the driver marker follow the route/road. We need to animate along each segment in the route until we reach the segment which has the driver position that we received.</p><p>There are again two cases here 😜:</p><h3 id=\"3-3-1-the-new-driver-location-is-on-the-same-segment\">3.3.1: The new driver location is on the same segment</h3><p>In this case, we can directly animate from the current position of driver marker to the driver location that we received since this is just a straight line animation.</p><p>A segment is always a straight line. We will discuss more on how to do the animation b/w 2 points in a later section.</p><h3 id=\"3-3-2-the-new-driver-location-is-on-a-different-segment\">3.3.2: The new driver location is on a different segment</h3><p>In this case, we need to animate to that segment along the route. We have to animate along each of the segments in between to reach the final segment.</p><p>For animation along the first segment, we set the endpoint of the animation to the beginning of the next segment in the route. We animate to the end of the first segment.</p><p>The next segment may also not have the driver location that we received. After a driver has traversed the first segment, we move the end location of the animation to the end of the next segment, and so on and so forth till we reach the last segment. Confusing, ya? Let’s see an example.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://gojek-ghost.zysk.in/content/images/2020/05/Screenshot-2020-05-23-at-10.06.55-PM.png\" class=\"kg-image\"><figcaption>So much zig-zag (huh!!)</figcaption></figure><p>The car icon(A) represents the location in the segment where the driver marker currently is.

But the journey doesn’t stop there. Even after\nbuilding all these convenient products, we still try and reduce frictions that\nmay be encountered even within our app — such as booking a ride or ordering\nfood.\n\nSo we thought, why don’t we integrate with Google Assistant, and let our users\ncommunicate with our products in a new way?\n\nIn this post, we explain how we integrated our food and transport products with\nthe Google Assistant.\n\nThe why\nWe’ve already addressed one part of the why — convenience. The other is user\nre-engagement. According to this survey\n[https://andrewchen.co/new-data-shows-why-losing-80-of-your-mobile-users-is-normal-and-that-the-best-apps-do-much-better/?utm_content=buffere4fa2&utm_medium=twitter.com&utm_source=social&utm_campaign=buffer] \nconducted by Silicon Valley researcher Andrew Chen 77% of users stop using an\napp three days after they install it. Within a month, that number goes up to\n90%. ?\n\nThe how\nTo help integrate Android apps with the Google Assistant, Google launched App\nActions:\n\nWhat are app actions?\nApp Actions are a new way to make your android app content available in places\nlike Google Search, Google Assistant etc. From a user’s perspective, App Actions\nbehave like shortcuts to parts of your Android app. When users invoke an App\nAction, the Assistant either launches a screen in the Android app that the user\nhas already installed or shows an embedded visual card (Android Slice) that\nusers can interact with.\n\nApp actions provide a faster way for users to access Android apps. It can be\nachieved in two ways:- either user can be directed to a specific\nactivity(screen) using a deep link or user may see relevant content on the\nAssistant itself called Slices.\n\nMore info on this can be found here: \nhttps://developers.google.com/assistant/app/overview\n\nWhat are Slices?\nSlices are super-powered app actions. They provide a way to interact with apps\nwithout moving away from Assistant by showing a small piece of UI within\nAssistant. Slices are UI templates that can display rich, dynamic, and\ninteractive content from the app in Google Assistant.\n\nSlices can help users perform tasks faster by enabling engagement outside of the\nfullscreen app experience.\n\nYou can build Slices as enhancements to App Actions.\n\nHere’s an example:\n\nWe choose to use slices to show food order status, as the order status will have\nlimited information (eg. Driver is on the way to Restaurant, with his location\non Map ) which can be easily shown in a small piece of UI segment.\n\nIn fact, this functionality was recently demoed on stage at a Google event in\nIndonesia. You can check it out below:\n\nApp Actions Demo at #Google4ID 2019How does it work?\nWhenever a user says or types something in Assistant, assistant parses the\nquery. If the query matches the built-in intent\n[https://developers.google.com/assistant/app/reference/built-in-intents] grammar\nthen Google Assistant extracts the query parameter in schema.org\n[https://schema.org/] and generates a deep link URL using the mapping we provide\nin an actions.xml file.\n\nGoogle then attaches those extracted parameters to the deep link URL and creates\na final deep link which allows a user to launch specific content or screens in\nthe app.\n\nLet’s dig a little deeper:\n\nGoogle applies Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (Natural Language\nProcessing) to understand all the sentences we type in Assistant.\n\nWhile users can type anything they want in Assistant and the system gets better\nat interpreting them over time, but there are some sentences for specific intent\nthat are fixed by Google. More info here\n[https://developers.google.com/assistant/app/reference/built-in-intents#create-taxi-reservation]\n.\n\nHow did we integrate our services with Assistant?\nThe core of integrating Gojek with Assistant involved creating actions on Google\nAssistant with actions.xml file.\n\nLet’s explore how to do this:\n\n1. Create actions.xml file in your XML folder. This contains all the actions\nwith built-in intents which define what actions our app can support in the\nAssistant. Each action contains built-in intents\n[https://developers.google.com/assistant/app/reference/built-in-intents#create-taxi-reservation] \nsupported by Google as a <intent-name> tag.\n\n2. Define a fulfilment mode for each app action — which can be deep links or\nslices. You have to pass a fulfilment mode in each action. This is compulsory.\n\n3. Pass the URL template which will allow a user to launch your app — this can\nbe the deep link to your app or URL to Slice provider.\n\n4. Define entity-set — the Gojek app is available in multiple locales, so to\nprovide locale for all the regions, we added the entity-set, which allows\nAssistant to understand more than one version of category. ex:- taxi can be\npronounced as taksi in Bahasa.\n\nSo, If you want locale for your specific parameter in deep-link URL, you can\nsimply attach an entity-set with that parameter, see how you can achieve this in\nbelow example\n\n<parameter name=”taxiReservation.category”><entity-set-reference\nentitySetId=”TransportCategoryEntitySet” /></parameter>\n\n5. Add a reference to actions.xml file using the <meta> tag in your app’s\nmanifest.xml file inside the application tag.\n\nIn order to integrate Slices:\n\n 1. Implement an Android Slice by following the steps described in the Slices\n    Getting Started guide\n    [https://developer.android.com/guide/slices/getting-started].\n 2. In the actions.xml file, in the <fulfillment> element, specify \n    fulfillmentMode=“actions.fulfillment.SLICE” to indicate that a user intent\n    can be fulfilled using a Slice in your app.\n\nA few quick notes on what we learnt\n 1. Testing this feature is pretty hard and things become weird when you have\n    multiple build types of your app. For testing, you need a build type on the\n    Play Store, (which means the package name of the testing build should match\n    the package name of the published app). You can use a plugin (developed by\n    Google) called App Actions Test Tool\n    [https://developers.google.com/assistant/app/test-tool] for testing this\n    feature.\n\n> Please make sure you are following points while testing with App Actions Test\nTool:\na) Log in to Android Studio and Google Assistant with the account which has\naccess to your published app on Play console.\nb) ApplicationId of the app should be the same as your published app.\nc) Your Gradle should be built successfully.\nd) Use App Action Tool to create and update preview and test the app actions and\nslice.\n2.

Here’s what we learned in the process.</h3><p><strong><strong><em>By Vikas Bajpayee and Lokesh Kalal</em></strong></strong></p><p>Our aim behind building a Super App was to help our users get rid of the daily frictions in their lives. But the journey doesn’t stop there. Even after building all these convenient products, we still try and reduce frictions that may be encountered even within our app — such as booking a ride or ordering food.</p><p>So we thought, why don’t we integrate with Google Assistant, and let our users communicate with our products in a new way?</p><p>In this post, we explain how we integrated our food and transport products with the Google Assistant.</p><h1 id=\"the-why\">The why</h1><p>We’ve already addressed one part of the <em><em>why — </em></em>convenience. The other is user re-engagement. According to <a href=\"https://andrewchen.co/new-data-shows-why-losing-80-of-your-mobile-users-is-normal-and-that-the-best-apps-do-much-better/?utm_content=buffere4fa2&amp;utm_medium=twitter.com&amp;utm_source=social&amp;utm_campaign=buffer\" rel=\"noopener\">this survey</a> conducted by Silicon Valley researcher Andrew Chen 77% of users stop using an app three days after they install it. Within a month, that number goes up to 90%. ?</p><h1 id=\"the-how\">The how</h1><p>To help integrate Android apps with the Google Assistant, Google launched App Actions:</p><h2 id=\"what-are-app-actions\">What are app actions?</h2><p>App Actions are a new way to make your android app content available in places like Google Search, Google Assistant etc. From a user’s perspective, App Actions behave like shortcuts to parts of your Android app. When users invoke an App Action, the Assistant either launches a screen in the Android app that the user has already installed or shows an embedded visual card (Android Slice) that users can interact with.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/260/1*w4jk-CTME9amkb5dsIQDzw.gif\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>App actions provide a faster way for users to access Android apps. It can be achieved in two ways:- either user can be directed to a specific activity(screen) using a deep link or user may see relevant content on the Assistant itself called Slices.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/260/1*KPBLtVMjiHBOPEJ53E9F8A.gif\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>More info on this can be found here: <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/assistant/app/overview\" rel=\"noopener\">https://developers.google.com/assistant/app/overview</a></p><h2 id=\"what-are-slices\"><strong>What are Slices?</strong></h2><p>Slices are super-powered app actions. They provide a way to interact with apps without moving away from Assistant by showing a small piece of UI within Assistant. Slices are UI templates that can display rich, dynamic, and interactive content from the app in Google Assistant.</p><p><em><em>Slices can help users perform tasks faster by enabling engagement outside of the fullscreen app experience.</em></em></p><p>You can build Slices as enhancements to App Actions.</p><p>Here’s an example:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1080/1*EFF30b3185UtwKYjx0VP1A.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>We choose to use slices to show food order status, as the order status will have limited information (eg. Driver is on the way to Restaurant, with his location on Map ) which can be easily shown in a small piece of UI segment.</p><p>In fact, this functionality was recently demoed on stage at a Google event in Indonesia. You can check it out below:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card kg-card-hascaption\"><iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2F0u20Iu4m2Co%3Fstart%3D5805%26feature%3Doembed%26start%3D5805&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D0u20Iu4m2Co&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2F0u20Iu4m2Co%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"480\" width=\"854\" title=\"#Google4ID 2019\" class=\"s t u iu ai\" scrolling=\"auto\" style=\"box-sizing: inherit; position: absolute; top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 680px; height: 382.188px;\"></iframe><figcaption>App Actions Demo at #Google4ID 2019</figcaption></figure><h1 id=\"how-does-it-work\"><strong>How does it work?</strong></h1><p>Whenever a user says or types something in Assistant, assistant parses the query. If the query matches the<a href=\"https://developers.google.com/assistant/app/reference/built-in-intents\" rel=\"noopener\"> built-in intent</a> grammar then Google Assistant extracts the query parameter in<a href=\"https://schema.org/\" rel=\"noopener\"> schema.org</a> and generates a deep link URL using the mapping we provide in an actions.xml file.</p><p>Google then attaches those extracted parameters to the deep link URL and creates a final deep link which allows a user to launch specific content or screens in the app.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1490/0*jUlpzwbXbFIgGy7s\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>Let’s dig a little deeper:</p><p>Google applies Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (Natural Language Processing) to understand all the sentences we type in Assistant.</p><p>While users can type anything they want in Assistant and the system gets better at interpreting them over time, but there are some sentences for specific intent that are fixed by Google. More info <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/assistant/app/reference/built-in-intents#create-taxi-reservation\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>.</p><h1 id=\"how-did-we-integrate-our-services-with-assistant\"><strong>How did we integrate our services with Assistant?</strong></h1><p>The core of integrating Gojek with Assistant involved creating actions on Google Assistant with actions.xml file.</p><p>Let’s explore how to do this:</p><p>1. Create <strong><strong>actions.xml</strong></strong> file in your XML folder. This contains all the actions with built-in intents which define what actions our app can support in the Assistant. Each action contains<a href=\"https://developers.google.com/assistant/app/reference/built-in-intents#create-taxi-reservation\" rel=\"noopener\"> built-in intents</a> supported by Google as a &lt;intent-name&gt; tag.</p><p>2. Define a fulfilment mode for each app action — which can be deep links or slices. You have to pass a fulfilment mode in each action. This is compulsory.</p><p>3. Pass the URL template which will allow a user to launch your app — this can be the deep link to your app or URL to Slice provider.</p><p>4. Define entity-set — the Gojek app is available in multiple locales, so to provide locale for all the regions, we added the entity-set, which allows Assistant to understand more than one version of category. ex:- taxi can be pronounced as taksi in Bahasa.</p><p>So, If you want locale for your specific parameter in deep-link URL, you can simply attach an entity-set with that parameter, see how you can achieve this in below example</p><p><em>&lt;parameter name=”taxiReservation.category”&gt;&lt;entity-set-reference entitySetId=”TransportCategoryEntitySet” /&gt;&lt;/parameter&gt;</em></p><p>5. Add a reference to <strong><strong>actions.xml</strong></strong> file using the &lt;meta&gt; tag in your app’s manifest.xml file inside the application tag.</p><p><strong><strong>In order to integrate Slices:</strong></strong></p><ol><li>Implement an Android Slice by following the steps described in the <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/guide/slices/getting-started\" rel=\"noopener\">Slices Getting Started guide</a>.</li><li>In the actions.xml file, in the <code>&lt;fulfillment&gt;</code> element, specify <code>fulfillmentMode=“actions.fulfillment.SLICE”</code> to indicate that a user intent can be fulfilled using a Slice in your app.</li></ol><h1 id=\"a-few-quick-notes-on-what-we-learnt\"><strong>A few quick notes on what we learnt</strong></h1><ol><li>Testing this feature is pretty hard and things become weird when you have multiple build types of your app. For testing, you need a build type on the Play Store, (which means the package name of the testing build should match the package name of the published app). You can use a plugin (developed by Google) called<a href=\"https://developers.google.com/assistant/app/test-tool\" rel=\"noopener\"> <strong><strong>App Actions Test Tool</strong></strong></a> for testing this feature.</li></ol><blockquote><em><em>Please make sure you are following points while testing with App Actions Test Tool:</em></em><br><em><em>a) Log in to Android Studio and Google Assistant with the account which has access to your published app on Play console.</em></em><br><em><em>b) <code>ApplicationId</code> of the app should be the same as your published app.</em></em><br><em><em>c) Your Gradle should be built successfully.</em></em><br><em><em>d) Use App Action Tool to create and update preview and test the app actions and slice.</em></em></blockquote><p>2. If your app is used in different locales, you can create locales using <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/assistant/app/action-schema#entity-set-reference\" rel=\"noopener\">entity-set</a> in the actions.xml file.</p><p>3. In order to give early builds to QA or other users (if you have multiple build types in your app), you can create an internal test track on Play console and add relevant people to it. This allows you to share the build to production for only some listed users.</p><p>(See <a href=\"https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/3131213?hl=en\" rel=\"noopener\">this</a> for how you can create an internal test track for your app.)</p><p>4. Actions.xml shouldn’t be <strong><strong>obfuscated</strong></strong> in release apk — it means if you are using any obfuscated tools like proguard then actions.xml shouldn’t be obfuscated there.</p><p>5. Slices can be requested before the <code>onCreate</code> of your application is completed. You can run into issues if you are using something which is initialised in <code>onCreate</code> while creating slices.</p><p>6. Don't refresh slices from <code>onBindSlice()</code> method, it will end up in an infinite loop where Google Assistant will call <code>onBindSlice()</code> infinitely.</p><p>That’s all from us folks. Hope this post gave you a better understanding of how App Actions and Slices work with Google Assistant. Working on this feature was an amazing experience for us.

Our pickup points are\ndesigned to make lives easier for both customers and driver partners.\n\nThis is possible because the pickup points shown on the app are popular pickup\nlocations around the area. What’s more, the pickup point names are displayed\nexactly how customers driver partners usually refer to them.\n\nBut how do we manage to name so many pickup points accurately, and at scale?\n\nWe use past booking locations and their associated chat logs to discover named\npickup points. As our previous research has explained, we first perform \nclustering\n[https://blog.gojekengineering.com/fantastic-drivers-and-how-to-find-them-a88239ef3b29] \non historical bookings to form potential pickup points, then we use a language\nmodel\n[https://blog.gojekengineering.com/how-i-met-my-gojek-driver-without-a-single-call-95041f4fdd03] \nto select the best name. Here, we explain how we improved upon the previous\nstatistical language model with a state-of-the-art NLP model, which makes the\nentire naming exercise fully scalable. This is the magic behind all the pickup\npoints seen on the Gojek app.\n\nHow can we learn better?\nAs explained in our previous post, our original statistical language model\nselects the best pickup point name from the most probable n-grams extracted from\nbookings text. However, such a statistical language model doesn’t ‘understand’\nthe meaning of the texts, it simply chooses phrases with high frequencies\nwithout knowing the semantics. Sometimes it throws street names, sometimes even\ncommon phrases with no information about location. We have to manually check\neverything to make sure it reflects the right POI, before it appears on the app.\n\nThis creates a challenge — especially if we want to quickly expand the\nfrictionless pickup experience to customers across in new geographies. Hence, we\ndecided to go a step further with a deep-learning NLP model that ‘understands’\nand ‘learns’ to differentiate what is a valid pickup point name.\n\nAt Gojek, we never stop thinking and always go a step further\n\nMeet CartoBERT ?\nOne of the most recent and impactful breakthroughs NLP was the publication of\nBERT[1] — a contextual language representation with transformer models — by\nGoogle in late 2018. It obtained state-of-the-art results on a wide array of NLP\ntasks. In the 2019, many NLP researches were influenced by BERT, including\nXLNet, RoBERTa, ERNIE etc.\n\nBERT Explained\nBERT, or Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, is composed of\nan embedding layer, followed by groups of transformer layers.\n\nEvery word (token) in the input sentence will first get encoded into its\nembedding representations in the embedding layer, and then go through\nbidirectional transformer encoder layers. Every encoder layer will perform the\nmulti-head attention computation on the token representation from the previous\nlayer to create a new intermediate representation, which is then output to the\nnext layer. The output from the final layer is the contextual representation of\nthe input token. A pooled sentence level representation combining all token\nrepresentations could be created if needed by specific downstream tasks.\n\nWith the final contextual representations at either token or sentence level, a\npre-trained BERT on large unlabelled text corpus, could be further extended to a\nwide variety of NLP tasks, such as text classification, question answering,\nNamed Entity Recognition (NER) etc.\n\nALBERT[2], published by Google in Sep 2019, improved on BERT with embedding\nparameter factorisation and cross layer parameter sharing to reduce the number\nof parameters (by 9 times for base model). It also uses sequence order\nprediction instead of next sentence prediction for the pre-train task. In the\npaper, ALBERT also outperforms BERT on standard NLP tasks/datasets (SQUAD, RACE\netc), with fewer parameters.\n\nPre-train CartoBERT to learn language representation from Gojek bookings text\nInspired by ALBERT’s lightweight model and performance, we developed CartoBERT,\nGojek’s very own pickup point name recognition model, based on ALBERT’s\narchitecture.\n\nAs illustrated below, the uncased CartoBERT is pre-trained on Gojek’s own masked\nbookings text corpus of about 200 million sentences. Booking text is first\npre-processed for data masking to mask all customer sensitive information,\nlanguage detection, text normalisation (including text cleaning, slang,\nabbreviation transformations, lowercase transformation and emoji removal). The\npre-processed text is used to build subword vocabularies which handles\nOut-Of-Vocabulary (OOV) tokens that could be decomposed to frequent subword\npatterns. CartoBERT tokenizer is then created with the subword vocabularies and\nfurther used to encode and tokenize the same preprocessed bookings text to form\npre-trained input files.\n\nSame as ALBERT, the model is pre-trained to ‘understand’ Gojek’s bookings text\nusing Masked Language Model — which predicts randomly masked tokens in input\nsentences — and Sentence Order Prediction tasks, which predicts the order of\ninput sentences pair.\n\nFine-tuning CartoBERT to extract pickup point names from Gojek bookings text\nWith the huge amount of bookings text we have at Gojek, now CartoBERT can better\n‘understand’ past bookings text. Theoretically, it ‘understands’ every word of a\nbooking text sentence.\n\nFor every token in the input sentence, CartoBERT will output a 768-dimension\nvector (we use the default hidden layer size of the ALBERT base model in\nCartoBERT, however this is configurable) from last transformer encoder layer,\nand we use that to represent CartoBERT’s ‘understanding’ of the token’s meaning\nin the sentence context for fine-tune step.\n\nAs illustrated in the diagram below, while fine-tuning CartoBERT for pickup\npoint name recognition, we replace the Masked Language Model and Sequence Order\nPrediction layers from CartoBERT in pre-train step with token classification\nlayer. The token classification layer learns to predict the probability of a\ntoken belonging to a pickup point name, with the final token representation\noutput from CartoBERT transformer layers, from labelled training data created\nwith bookings text sentences, and corresponding pickup point names. Here, we use\nweighted cross entropy loss to deal with class imbalance, as tokens tagged to\npickup point names are a minority.\n\n\n\nWith this, CartoBERT is fine-tuned to extract pickup point names from bookings\ntext sentences, if any.\n\nHow does the model perform?\nCartoBERT gives a lift of more than 25% in pickup point name accuracy to ~93%\naccuracy, which is measured as the percentage of valid pick up point names out\nof generated names. With this high accuracy, we have achieved full scalability\nof automatic generation for named pickup points to quickly cover multiple\ngeographies without heavy reliance on human inputs.\n\nWhat’s next?\nWe are not stopping here and are exploring using active learning to further\nimprove CartoBERT. With active learning, we only flag out uncertain predictions,\nwhich are measured as sentence level least token probability[3] for human\nlabelling. We then use human-curated data as feedback for model learning. In\nthis way, we can improve model learning efficiency with minimum labelling\neffort.\n\nWhat’s more, with the success of CartoBERT, we are considering pre-training and\nopen sourcing a general Indonesia Bahasa ALBERT model with Indonesia open corpus\nfrom wiki, news, Twitter etc. Currently, the options for open-sourced language\nmodel in Indonesia Bahasa are very limited, only pre-trained static word\nembeddings such as word2vec, fasttext etc are available. It would be beneficial\nto the community if we have a good state-of-the-art attention-based transformer\nmodel for the language. Stay tuned for more updates from the Cartography Data\nScience team. ?\n\nLeave a ? if you liked what you read.

A pooled sentence level representation combining all token representations could be created if needed by specific downstream tasks.</p><p>With the final contextual representations at either token or sentence level, a pre-trained BERT on large unlabelled text corpus, could be further extended to a wide variety of NLP tasks, such as text classification, question answering, Named Entity Recognition (NER) etc.</p><p>ALBERT[2], published by Google in Sep 2019, improved on BERT with embedding parameter factorisation and cross layer parameter sharing to reduce the number of parameters (by 9 times for base model). It also uses sequence order prediction instead of next sentence prediction for the pre-train task. In the paper, ALBERT also outperforms BERT on standard NLP tasks/datasets (SQUAD, RACE etc), with fewer parameters.</p><h2 id=\"pre-train-cartobert-to-learn-language-representation-from-gojek-bookings-text\">Pre-train CartoBERT to learn language representation from Gojek bookings text</h2><p>Inspired by ALBERT’s lightweight model and performance, we developed CartoBERT, Gojek’s very own pickup point name recognition model, based on ALBERT’s architecture.</p><p>As illustrated below, the uncased CartoBERT is pre-trained on Gojek’s own masked bookings text corpus of about 200 million sentences. Booking text is first pre-processed for data masking to mask all customer sensitive information, language detection, text normalisation (including text cleaning, slang, abbreviation transformations, lowercase transformation and emoji removal). The pre-processed text is used to build subword vocabularies which handles Out-Of-Vocabulary (OOV) tokens that could be decomposed to frequent subword patterns. CartoBERT tokenizer is then created with the subword vocabularies and further used to encode and tokenize the same preprocessed bookings text to form pre-trained input files.</p><p>Same as ALBERT, the model is pre-trained to ‘understand’ Gojek’s bookings text using Masked Language Model — which predicts randomly masked tokens in input sentences — and Sentence Order Prediction tasks, which predicts the order of input sentences pair.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1386/1*STaqWssxlYPhFaDulLwJzg.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><h2 id=\"fine-tuning-cartobert-to-extract-pickup-point-names-from-gojek-bookings-text\">Fine-tuning CartoBERT to extract pickup point names from Gojek bookings text</h2><p>With the huge amount of bookings text we have at Gojek, now CartoBERT can better ‘understand’ past bookings text. Theoretically, it ‘understands’ every word of a booking text sentence.</p><p>For every token in the input sentence, CartoBERT will output a 768-dimension vector (we use the default hidden layer size of the ALBERT base model in CartoBERT, however this is configurable) from last transformer encoder layer, and we use that to represent CartoBERT’s ‘understanding’ of the token’s meaning in the sentence context for fine-tune step.</p><p>As illustrated in the diagram below, while fine-tuning CartoBERT for pickup point name recognition, we replace the Masked Language Model and Sequence Order Prediction layers from CartoBERT in pre-train step with token classification layer. The token classification layer learns to predict the probability of a token belonging to a pickup point name, with the final token representation output from CartoBERT transformer layers, from labelled training data created with bookings text sentences, and corresponding pickup point names. Here, we use weighted cross entropy loss to deal with class imbalance, as tokens tagged to pickup point names are a minority.</p><p></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1526/1*WO1LRHQPqAqzpLBMMl-NuA.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>With this, CartoBERT is fine-tuned to extract pickup point names from bookings text sentences, if any.</p><h2 id=\"how-does-the-model-perform\">How does the model perform?</h2><p>CartoBERT gives a lift of more than 25% in pickup point name accuracy to ~93% accuracy, which is measured as the percentage of valid pick up point names out of generated names. With this high accuracy, we have achieved full scalability of automatic generation for named pickup points to quickly cover multiple geographies without heavy reliance on human inputs.</p><h1 id=\"what-s-next\">What’s next?</h1><p>We are not stopping here and are exploring using active learning to further improve CartoBERT. With active learning, we only flag out uncertain predictions, which are measured as sentence level least token probability[3] for human labelling. We then use human-curated data as feedback for model learning. In this way, we can improve model learning efficiency with minimum labelling effort.</p><p>What’s more, with the success of CartoBERT, we are considering pre-training and open sourcing a general Indonesia Bahasa ALBERT model with Indonesia open corpus from wiki, news, Twitter etc. Currently, the options for open-sourced language model in Indonesia Bahasa are very limited, only pre-trained static word embeddings such as word2vec, fasttext etc are available. It would be beneficial to the community if we have a good state-of-the-art attention-based transformer model for the language. Stay tuned for more updates from the Cartography Data Science team. ?</p><p>Leave a ? if you liked what you read.

As\ngovernments and authorities encourage social distancing, many companies — Gojek\nincluded — have started to put a heightened emphasis on working from home. As an\norganization with a distributed workforce, we have offices in Indonesia,\nSingapore, Vietnam, Thailand, Philippines, and India, a remote strategy has\nalways been embedded in our DNA. This post details some lessons and what we\nthink are ‘best practices’ to follow in a Work from home (WFH) situation.\n\nAt the outset, it’s important to call out a key point: During this time of\nuncertainty, employees may not be at their productive best. There’s a lot of\nanxiety with family and friends, and rightly so. WFH requires high \nAccountability, but also Empathy and Trust. Be mindful, this is a stressful time\nfor everyone. Trust your colleagues to do the best they can given the times.\n\nBefore we begin — context\nGojek has always been mindful of our employees’ health and wellbeing. We have\nunlimited sick leaves, and encourage employees to work where and when they are\nat their productive best. We have proven success — with functional leaders\nworking fully remotely without compromising on effectively launching org-wide\ninitiatives: career ladders, new hiring programs, even setting up an entire new\nfunction. But this is by all means not a comprehensive or a definitive guide.\nThink of this as a ‘beta’ document summarising some lessons in a bid to get\nfeedback from you, our readers. We’re putting this out there so we can learn\ntogether to do better.\n\nIf you think we’ve missed out on something, please leave a comment — will help\nus a long way in fine-tuning our own practices. These are trying times, and we\nwant to do what is right for everyone.\n\n(1)The right environment\nOffice spaces provide designated areas employees start associating with work and\nfocus. This may not be the case in a home environment, so it is important to\nrecreate this space. Some ideal prerequisites include an area with plenty of\nlight, minimal distractions and a comfortable desk and chair.\n\nWorking from home also potentially involves sharing the space with other family\nmembers / housemates.

Be respectful and considerate\n— everyone’s doing the best they can. Set up core work hours when the entire\nteam is expected to be available and clearly define these on a calendar. Be\nmindful of each other’s calendars and schedule sensitively so all concerned\nparties can extract the maximum output from their workday.\n\nQuantify what is being done at the end of each day, and by whom. Transparency is\nkey here. You can shape this right at the beginning during daily team meetings.\nWhen social interactions with colleagues are virtual, you as a manager, or an\nemployer, tend to worry about accountability. Maintain a notepad of things you\ndid, what you’re working on, when others can expect work to be delivered, and\nwhen you will respond to messages or requests. This reduces anxiety and helps\nyou plan your day. In the midst of all this, don’t forget to respect your own\ntime as well. Define your working hours, and stop once they are up.\n\nIt’s equally easy to also overwork yourself when working from home. Be mindful\nof your on-screen time.\n\nSnackable hacks\nWe spoke to a bunch of Gojek folks to get some of their actionable WFH hacks:\n\n * If you find your attention span dwindling, take time off, browse your\n   favorite social media app, go for a walk — get that Vitamin D in, talk to a\n   friend/family member etc…\n * Eat on time, eat healthy — set timelines for this on your calendar so you’re\n   not skipping meals.\n * Create a mini-team virtual group just for social interactions that do not\n   discuss work — movies, books, art, interesting articles etc.\n * Hydrate. Stretch every 30 minutes. Hydrate. Have strict timelines on when you\n   eat. Do not sway here. Did we say hydrate? Hydrate.\n * Team calls should start with something fun — a new fact you learnt, an\n   interesting fact you learnt, or something interesting going on in team\n   member’s lives outside of work.\n * Change into a separate set of clothes during core working hours, even if they\n   are just a different set of comfortable PJs. It helps delineate “work time”\n   from “waking up” or “me time” when both are happening in the same place. It’s\n   tempting to work in bed while wearing the clothes you slept in, but avoid\n   this!\n * Your calendar is sacred — set timers for food breaks, leisure walks, time\n   off, family obligations etc.\n * Call out good work!

Empathy & Trust — The two key words you want to keep in mind. ✌️","html":"<p>By Kevin Aluwi</p><p>It’s been a trying couple of weeks since the Coronavirus outbreak. As governments and authorities encourage social distancing, many companies — Gojek included — have started to put a heightened emphasis on working from home. As an organization with a distributed workforce, we have offices in Indonesia, Singapore, Vietnam, Thailand, Philippines, and India, a remote strategy has always been embedded in our DNA. This post details some lessons and what we think are ‘best practices’ to follow in a Work from home (WFH) situation.</p><p><em><em>At the outset, it’s important to call out a key point: During this time of uncertainty, employees may not be at their productive best. There’s a lot of anxiety with family and friends, and rightly so. WFH requires high </em></em><strong><strong><em><em>Accountability</em></em></strong></strong><em><em>, but also </em></em><strong><strong><em><em>Empathy</em></em></strong></strong><em><em> and </em></em><strong><strong><em><em>Trust</em></em></strong></strong><em><em>. Be mindful, this is a stressful time for everyone. Trust your colleagues to do the best they can given the times.</em></em></p><h3 id=\"before-we-begin-context\">Before we begin — context</h3><p>Gojek has always been mindful of our employees’ health and wellbeing. We have unlimited sick leaves, and encourage employees to work where and when they are at their productive best. <strong><strong>We have proven success</strong></strong> — with functional leaders working fully remotely without compromising on effectively launching org-wide initiatives: career ladders, new hiring programs, even setting up an entire new function. But this is by all means <strong><strong>not</strong></strong> a comprehensive or a definitive guide. Think of this as a ‘beta’ document summarising some lessons in a bid to get feedback from you, our readers. We’re putting this out there so we can learn together to do better.</p><p><em><em>If you think we’ve missed out on something, please leave a comment — will help us a long way in fine-tuning our own practices. These are trying times, and we want to do what is right for everyone.</em></em></p><h3 id=\"-1-the-right-environment\">(1)The right environment</h3><p>Office spaces provide designated areas employees start associating with work and focus. This may not be the case in a home environment, so it is important to recreate this space.

After the programming language, a very important component for the\ndev workflow is a good IDE.\n\nPurists generally rave about the use of Editors like Sublime, VSCode or even use\nof Vim/Emacs over full-fledged IDE’s like Jetbrains IntelliJ, Pycharm or\nEclipse. However, the truth is most modern devs in this day and age use/prefer\nIDE’s for the host of convenience features, speed, and flexibility they provide.\n\nPersonally, I am a big fan of IDE’s provided by Jetbrains\n[https://www.jetbrains.com/], and they are generally my tools of choice—saving\nme a ton of time while performing refactoring and greatly decreasing development\ntime.\n\n> Not convinced yet?\nIf you’ve used IntelliJ, then ppen up IntelliJ > Help > Productivity Guide and\nsee how much time it has saved you.\n\nThis is my breakdown in the past two years:\n\nHowever,\n\n * Do we really extract the maximum juice out of these tools?\n * How many of the IDE’s features do we really use on a day-to-day basis?\n\nWell, fret not. This post will share some awesome tips that you can also follow\nto become more productive with your editors. I got to know some of these\nfeatures when the prolific Dev evangelist Hadi Hariri [https://hadihariri.com/] \nfrom Jetbrains visited Gojek [https://www.gojek.io/] Bengaluru and shared these\nduring a meetup.\n\nTo demonstrate these features, I would be using appium Java client\n[https://github.com/appium/java-client] project but the same features can be\napplied in any Java/Kotlin (IntelliJ IDEA) project of your choice or Python\nproject (In Pycharm).\n\nIdeavim\nTo start with, did you know all Jetbrains editors come with a very good VIM\nsupport via IdeaVim plugin? Vim commands are amazing.\n\nOnce you get used to them, your editing and code navigation speed is easily\nmultiplied 2X and it’s so easy to use it within IntelliJ. If you want to know\nVIM basics, I wrote a post\n[https://automationhacks.blog/2018/09/23/vim-the-editor-you-need-but-not-the-one-you-deserve/] \non it some time back.\n\nTo install this plugin, either opt for it when freshly installing IntelliJ or Go\nto preferences > Plugins and search for IdeaVim in marketplace, don't worry, you\ncan always temporarily disable it and practice first before starting to use it\nin your day to day workflow.\n\nThe most common commands that you should be aware of are mentioned right when\nyou open it.\n\nI use the IntelliJ IDEA classic keybindings, however, you should be able to\nquickly find the short cuts for these operations in the binding of your choice ( \nLook into Preferences > Keymap)\n\nSearch Shortcuts\nDouble Shift brings up the search console and this is the single place to either\n\n * Search Classes or Files (Shift + Cmd + N): with certain names in your project\n   or\n * Perform any action (Shift + Cmd + A): for example, refactoring certain\n   components inside a class\n\nYou can also easily learn the keyboard shortcuts for the common operations\nwithin the editor by seeing the shortcut right beside the command on this\nscreen. Trust me, the investment in learning these has huge payoffs.\n\n> The number of times that you avoid using the trackpad or mouse is one time less \nthat you have to context switch while coding. Believe me, that makes a\ndifference.\nSearch by file initials\nWhile trying to find a file, often we just know the name vaguely by memory. In\nSearch, it is sufficient to just mention the initials of the file and IntelliJ\nwill list out all the files which match that criteria\n\nLet’s say, for example, I want to search for all test files which start with A \nand have Test suffix, I can just enter ATes and see all the file names which\nmatch this.\n\nSearch method inside a file matching a pattern\nWhat if I want to search for all methods having find keyword inside test files\nnamed AndTes?\n\nWell you just use a dot . in these search queries and you can easily search for\neven methods inside classes based on partial pattern search.\n\nIn this case, AndTest.find would show all the methods with find keyword in them.\nNeat huh?\n\nSearch for file names inside a particular folder\nIn the example below, I am searching for file names starting with KeyE under \nnativekey folder by separating them with a forward slash /\n\nnativekey/KeyE\n\nNavigating options all within the search\nIf you type a forward slash / in the search bar, you can see different IDE\nactions that you can take right there.\n\nFind usages\nYou can quickly find out usages of a given function, class, interface, etc by\nhitting Cmd + B, This saves a ton of time over manually searching for code. You\ncan either navigate right inside the result pop up or open it in dedicated\nwindow by selecting Open in find window.\n\nWhat if I want to see all the classes and methods that are present in \nAndroidTest.java class?\n\nWe can open the Structure tab (Cmd + 7) and glance at all the available methods\nwith options to even show anonymous classes/lambdas inside the class.\n\nNow, this could be very useful when you have a long class and want to see all\nthe methods and then quickly navigate to them. Too many methods might hint at a\npotential refactoring candidate.\n\nSwitcher\nTo switch between open files and open tabs\n\nUse Ctrl + Tab and then to move down continue pressing Ctrl + Tab and to move up\nin switcher use Ctrl + Shift + Tab\n\nThis is a useful way to quickly navigate among files and menu options again\nwithout using mouse or trackpad\n\nRecent files\nYou do not need to remember what files were recently opened. To view recent\nfiles accessed, execute Cmd + E\n\nNavigation bar\nHow many times have you switched the project tree using Cmd + 1 and gone one\nlevel up to open a file? Before observing this, I know I kept on doing this\nagain and again.\n\nHowever, IntelliJ has a navigation bar on top of the editor which can be used to\nvery quickly navigate up the project tree.\n\nLive templates\nIntelliJ has a bunch of templates already created which can be quickly used to\ncreate a base skeleton code for many common constructs.\n\nIt is also aware of what type of file is currently opened and can show available\noptions by opening Cmd + J, once you select the one that you are looking for,\nexpand this code using Tab key\n\nTo open these templates and maybe even add your own, open Preferences > Editor >\nLive Templates\n\nInject language reference\nIntelliJ allows us to insert the context of a particular language and allows to\nwork with it within another file. Seems confusing? Let me explain why this is a\nsuper neat feature.\n\nLet’s assume you want to store JSON string inside a Java file. Typically Java 8\ndoes not have support for multi-line string (Added in Java 12 though\n[https://dzone.com/articles/jdk-12-raw-string-literals])\n\nYou can start with a simple string variable. Press Option + Enter and select \nInject language or reference\n\nAnd then select the file type. Let’s say JSON\n\nNow that we have provided the context, You can again press Option + Enter and\nthen select Edit JSON fragment . This opens up a new window where you can create\nand edit JSON freely and the corresponding concatenated string is automagically\ninserted.\n\nValidate regex inside the editor\nRegexes are a very powerful concept to learn and use. How many times have you\nhad to write small scratch files (or use regex sites [https://regexr.com/]) with\nbelow snippet to test whether a given string matches a regex?\n\nI have personally done this many times.\n\nclass Scratch {\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\nString regex = \"\\w+ world!\";\nString testString = \"Hello world!\";\nSystem.out.println(testString.matches(regex));\n}\n}\n\nIntelliJ makes this even easier. Given a regex, enter Option + Enter and select \nCheck RegExp\n\nEnter test strings and IntelliJ would automatically test whether the sample\nstring is a match or not. Neat right?\n\nDrop frames while debugging\nWhile developing it’s very important to be good at debugging. IntelliJ allows a\nvery rich set of inspection features to know the state of variables/classes at a\ngiven point in the code.\n\nIn this below example, we have a simple fooBar() method which is a wrapper over \nfoo and bar methods where foo has a debug point.\n\nWhat if we want to move a step back from the current frame? It turns out we can\nselect the current frame and select Drop frame and that would move the debug\nflow back to foo method.\n\nIt’s amazing how much time this saves since we do not need to rewire the\ndebugging session from scratch.\n\nHopefully, this post encouraged you to also explore the feature-rich IDEs that\nJetbrains provides, and give your automation development a literal nitro boost.\n(NFS reference anyone? 😋)\n\nWhat other IDE tricks have been lifesavers for you? Let me know in the comments.\nIf you found this useful, do share it with a friend or colleague.\n\nFor more such stories sent to your inbox once a week, sign up for our\nnewsletter!

Here’s\nwhat’s different:\n\nThere are two subtle changes — the colour of the button is a different shade of\ngreen and the elevation is also different.\n\nIn Asphalt\n[https://blog.gojekengineering.com/ux-engineering-at-gojek-9de2abe24928], our\ndesign language system, we want to make sure our UI components are robust and\ndetect breakages early. Here’s how we leveraged screenshot tests to achieve\nthis.\n\nComponents Everywhere\nAsphalt Components in Gojek appWith Asphalt, we create components that can be\nreused across the Gojek app. Every button, text, input, or card which you see in\nmost of the screens of the app is an Asphalt Component. On top of this, we have\na demo app which showcases the usage of these components.\n\nAsphalt Components in Demo appOur components are the backbone of the Gojek app\nUI. For example, our button class has 300+ occurrences across Gojek’s consumer\napp codebase. This heavy reuse helps us enforce design guidelines across the\napp. The importance of these components requires that we test them thoroughly,\nas even a small regression in one component could mean a degraded experience for\nour users.\n\n[U]n[I]t Testing\nUnit tests are supposed to test logic and fail when expectations aren’t met. How\ndo we expect that a certain UI is being rendered properly?\n\nThe idea of screenshot testing is to have a master copy of screenshots that we\nknow are correct and on every test run compare the current screenshots to the\nmaster copy. If the current set does not match the master set, the test fails.\nThis will allow us to check unintentional UI changes. If the changes are\nintentional, then we run the tests in update mode which updates the master\nscreenshots.\n\nHere is the high level outline:\n\n> - Write Espresso test for all activities in the demo\n> - Take screenshots and create a master set\n> - At every CI run take screenshots again and compare with master set\nWe started out with Shot [https://github.com/Karumi/Shot], an open source\nlibrary which allows us to take screenshots and compare them using gradle\ncommands and generate reports.\n\nHere’s what a test for our Alert component looks like 👇\n\nAchilles Heel — The Android Emulator\nWhile the Android emulator has improved a lot in recent times, we found running\nemulators in CI is still unreliable.\n\nHere are a few issues we faced:\n\n> - We had to wait to for the emulator to start up, which was only possible\nthrough a hack(y) script by continuously pinging adb commands\n> Emulator would put more memory pressure on CI runners\n> Emulators also need hardware acceleration which required us to enable kvm on our\nLinux-based machines.\nRunning Instrumentation test cases with these issues would mean our tests would\nbe flaky — and we couldn’t have that.\n\nFirebase Test Lab saves the day!\nWe decide to move away from emulators to real devices.\n\nOne idea was to have devices connected to a machine and use the machine as a\nrunner for running test cases in CI — a device test lab.\n\nBut devices come with their own baggage — maintaining them.

Instead, it expects you to\nupload a debug and a test apk, and it will run the tests for you. This meant we\ncould no longer use Shot for taking screenshots and comparing them 😦\n\nWhile scratching our heads over how to overcome this problem, we found that\nFirebase Test Lab allows you\n[https://firebase.google.com/docs/test-lab/android/test-screenshots] to take\nscreenshots through a library and then retrieve them from Google Cloud Bucket.\n\nThere is also a gradle plugin [https://github.com/runningcode/fladle/] which\nautomates this process including downloading artifacts from GCP — open source to\nthe rescue again!\n\nHere’s how our test case looks like with Firebase screenshot library:\n\nFor image comparison we used ImageMagick [https://imagemagick.org/], a very\npopular and feature-packed CLI tool for image manipulation. It also allows us to\noutput a different image in case two images don’t match, which is super useful\nfor generating test failure reports.\n\nThe final piece — integrating screenshot tests into our developer workflow\nAs part of CI, we do the following things when a merge request is raised:\n\n> - Build the project\n> - Run Espresso Tests on Firebase Test Lab\n> - Retrieve screenshots and compare them with master set\n> - If any screenshot doesn’t match, we fail the build and add a comment to PR\nusing Danger [https://danger.systems/]\nDanger reporting mismatch in screenshot along with diff image.We have been using\nthis setup for some time now, and it’s worked out great for us! We have been\nable to execute multiple UI refactors with high confidence.\n\nWhat’s next?\nWe will continue to invest in this setup in the future. Things like testing\nlocalisation, having a test matrix with multiple screen sizes, API levels,\ndevice densities… these are some things we have planned for the future.\n\nA big thank you to the open source libraries that helped us achieve this!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLiked what you read?

This allows users to have\nconversations with:\n\n * The currently assigned driver partner in relation to a booking.\n * Other Gojek users, provided they are known contacts in your address book.\n   These can be either personal or group chats.\n\nIn order to use the chat platform as springboard to other services within\nGojek’s vast ecosystem, we wanted to expose some features that integrate with\nour other offerings — within the convenience of a chat window.\n\nOne of the first service options we wanted to focus on was payments — paying and\nrequesting for money between individuals and groups. Chat had the platform to\ncreate connections between people, GoPay had payments — it was time to marry the\ntwo.\n\nArchitecture\nTo start with, as a chat platform team, we did not really know anything about\nthe payments domain. In fact, most of the integrations we planned for required\ncollaborating with other product teams within Gojek.\n\nWe decided early on that we needed a plugin-based framework that other product\nteams (and even chat team’s core services) could use. We also decided that the\nAPI surface area for this new framework should have as much as possible in\ncommon between the Android and iOS implementations.\n\nThe first use case we focused on was integrating payment options within chat —\nwhich would help us kickstart our design and feature rollout.\n\nApproach\nIn the vein of keeping things as simple as possible, we came up with the\nfollowing set of guidelines:\n\n * The chat subsystem can expose add-on features to the user\n * These features will not be part of the core chat offering, but can be\n   plugged-in externally\n * These plugin-based entities — chat extensions — can have mainly two\n   capabilities\n * Display a button (widget) in a chat window to trigger the chat extension’s\n   functionality\n * Display chat extension messages that can support rich text, images,\n   call-to-actions\n\nChat extension messages are merely text messages with additional metadata. While\nplain text-based messages are rendered by the core chat rendering system, chat\nextension messages need to be rendered by the chat extension that created the\nmessage.\n\nChat Extension Framework — Key ActorsThe illustration above depicts the final\nframework components we came up with.\n\n * Chat Extension Providers are responsible for vending Chat Extensions based on\n   the active Chat Session (there might be cases where we want to enable a\n   certain feature only for certain types of chats e.g. those between our\n   drivers and customers).\n * Chat Extensions are the components responsible for vending trigger points (\n   Widget Views) and custom message views (Extension Message Views).\n\nWhile the core subsystem takes care of managing life cycles of the chat\nextensions, widgets, and message views, it is the responsibility of extension\nauthors to purely focus on the implementation details of their feature.\n\nWith the above design in place, we were ready to start collaborating and start\nimplementing features.\n\nLet’s take a look at some integrations we were able to build collaboratively.\n\nSample Integrations\nPayments\nThe first integration we did was Request and Pay flows. Utilising GoPay,\ncustomers can make payments and request for money from friends.\n\nHere’s the Request Flow in action, within a personal chat:\n\nRequest Money from an IndividualIn a group chat, Request Flow translates to a\nSplit Bill flow:\n\nRequest Money in a GroupHere’s the Pay flow in action:\n\nPay via GoPay, continue conversation in ChatIn the Pay Flow, we start with\nmaking a payment from the home-screen of the Gojek App. Once a payment is done,\nyou have an option to continue to chat with the person you made the payment to.\nThis flow is of course in addition to similar flows for Request where you can\ntrigger a payment within chat itself.\n\nThe payments team were able to create a UX flow that could be triggered either\nfrom the home screen or the chat window.\n\nRestaurant Sharing\nNext up, our GoFood team wanted to explore sharing restaurant information via\nchat. Since we already had support for extensions at this point in time, we\ncreated a generic Share Via Chat flow that supports sharing simple text messages\nor custom extension message content.\n\nIn the Pay Flow, we start with making a payment from the home-screen of the\nGojek App. Once a payment is done, you have an option to continue to chat with\nthe person you made the payment to. This flow is of course in addition to\nsimilar flows for Request where you can trigger a payment within chat itself.\n\nThe payments team were able to create a UX flow that could be triggered either\nfrom the home screen or the chat window.\n\nRestaurant Sharing\nNext up, our GoFood team wanted to explore sharing restaurant information via\nchat. Since we already had support for extensions at this point in time, we\ncreated a generic Share Via Chat flow that supports sharing simple text messages\nor custom extension message content.\n\n\nShare Restaurant Details via ChatWhat’s interesting is that once a Restaurant\nCard has been shared via chat, a recipient clicking on that card can proceed to\nmake a food order, directly from the chat window itself. This is made possible\nby the fact that Extension Message Views can be fully interactive (e.g. detect\nuser taps), and the chat window provides contextual navigation controls to them.\n\nImage Sharing\nLastly, let us take a look at the most recent feature we rolled out to\nproduction — image sharing in our customer-driver chats.\n\nImage Sharing via ChatDuring the implementation of this feature, we recognised\nthat image sharing would be better triggered from the chat window if there was a\ndirect shortcut button (e.g. a camera icon) within the bottom text input area of\nthe chat window.\n\nThis leads us to enhance our extension framework to allow Chat Extensions to\nprovide Chat Extension Shortcuts as well. Our updated framework looks like\nbelow:\n\nLessons Learned\nIt has been a great journey so far exploring various kinds of integrations in a\nsimple chat window. We have a lot more planned, but in the meanwhile, here are a\nfew key things we learned along the way\n\n * When you are developing a platform, evangelising what your platform provides\n   is key. This is equally relevant if you are a platform-product company, or a\n   platform team within a company. We conducted an internal chat extension\n   hackathon which helped broaden our outreach, and saw some pretty cool ideas\n   implemented including Live Location Sharing, Booking Sharing, Games, Sticker\n   Packs etc.\n * Document your public API! Teams are more willing to collaborate if you have\n   proper, up-to-date documentation in place. We created detailed technical\n   documents, integration guides, and even provided a sample chat extension (a\n   starter-pack, if you will) — these greatly helped teams adopting these new\n   features. Also, the feedback we got during the internal hackathon fed\n   directly back into improving our documentation.\n * Having a common design language helped our Android and iOS engineers to\n   collaborate more closely. It was easier for the team to work on implementing\n   the feature by focussing on the common characteristics during tech\n   discussion, design ratification sessions etc. and leaving the nuances of each\n   platform to respective teams during development. Having a common language\n   that engineers can speak (irrespective of their specialisations) improves\n   cross-communications and collaboration.\n * It is important to design solutions exercising self-imposed constraints.\n   These constraints should directly limit the engineering scope of the\n   solution. As engineers, we are all too comfortable going down the technical\n   analysis rabbit-hole in our pursuit of coming up with a well rounded, albeit\n   (possibly) over-engineered solution. This usually ends up in complicated\n   designs, which translate into complicated code. It is better to design\n   simpler systems and iteratively add smaller features, where each iteration\n   cycle should also incorporate refactoring every step of the way. Even though\n   we knew having something like Extension Shortcuts was nice to have from the\n   get go, we had to exercise restraint and only implemented the feature when it\n   was actually required.\n * We cannot stress this enough, but continuous refactoring (whenever required)\n   is one surefire way to reduce the build-up of tech debt in any codebase.\n   Improve a function here, rename a variable there, refactor a class into two —\n   every little bit helps. It is the responsibility of the entire team to be\n   engaged in this exercise.\n\nSo there you have it, a quick look at the way the core chat team developed a\nbase extension framework that is currently being used to build richer\nintegrations into chat.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWant more where that come from?

Thinking about burgers and crispy chicken fritters\nwith creamy sauces sitting on a warm, soft bun? At least, that’s what I am\nthinking about. May be you’re different. Vegan perhaps? Or craving noodles? Each\nof us turn into a different person when we are hungry, and this is the story\nabout how GoFood — Gojek’s food delivery service — helps you find the bite you\ncrave.\n\n> At the core of the food ordering experience, sits search.\nSearches are part of so many of our interactions on web and mobile, that we\ndon’t even notice it anymore. This is mostly because modern search engines have\nmatured to a point where they can deliver high quality results even if the\nentered query is a weak signal of the user’s intent. Even when weak, every query\nstill contains a piece of the user’s intent.\n\nIn the case of GoFood, that piece is a fragment of our user’s hunger-driven\nbrain.\n\nIn this post, we’ll discuss how we personalise the search results we surface on\nGoFood, based on the information we have about our users’ food preferences.\n\nHow Each of Us Differ\nLet’s look at two of our GoFood users who have started feeling the pangs of\nhunger, and come online to check restaurants near them.\n\nThey both open our app and click on the NEAR ME tile that lets users find the\nrestaurants near them. We show them the nearest restaurants first, and this is\nwhat they both see.\n\n\nThis list goes on and on and will let them see each restaurant which is farther\nand farther away. They can now peruse the menus of each restaurant and pick one\nthat serves what they feel like ordering. The problem is that they may spend\nsome time scrolling and then leave the app without being able to make up their\nminds around which restaurant to place an order from. We have thrown too many\nchoices at them and the cognitive effort of picking a restaurant and then a dish\nfrom the menu is too much work to make them suffer through.\n\nBut wait. Both Mila and Husain have transacted with us in the past, and we know\na fair bit about their preferences. 🤔\n\nTo make this experience better, we decided to build a system that would let both\nof them see restaurants that suit their own tastes and preferences\n\nApplying Machine Learning to the Problem\nRanking documents for relevance works by assigning a prediction score to each\ndocument retrieved, which is directly proportional to its relevance. In the case\nof NEAR ME restaurant ranking this can be something like:\n\n> Relevance score = 2 * (1/distance) + 1.2 * rating of restaurant\nHere in the relevance score calculation, we are taking weighted sum of different\nfactors like (1/distance) and rating of restaurant. The coefficients/weights of\nthese factors can be arrived at by experimenting with them and choosing weights\nthat seem to maximise the ordering conversions. But, in the case of restaurant\nranking in GoFood, we want to take into consideration many factors when deciding\nrelevance. Unfortunately, experimenting with combinations of all those factors\nis impossible.\n\nEnter Learning to rank. Here, the problem of deciding the rank of the\nrestaurants shown to the user is formulated as a supervised machine learning\nproblem.\n\nIf we look at past search, click, and ordering data, we will be able to assign\nrelevance judgements to each restaurant listing according to whether our users\nclicked or ordered from one of those restaurants. Restaurants that attracted\nhigher degrees of interest will be given higher degrees of relevance.\n\nIn the below example, a relevance judgement level of 0,1 and 2 is assigned to a\nrestaurant according to whether the user viewed, clicked, or ordered from the\nrestaurant in the search result. The relevance judgements are relative and only\nintent to be monotonically increasing with increasing relevance . They say that\nthe restaurant which the user created an order from is more relevant than a\nrestaurant the user merely checked out by clicking on it. They don’t mean that\nthe restaurant which received the order is twice as relevant .\n\nThe values of each of the factors that could have played a role in the user’s\ndecision of clicking or ordering is also shown against the restaurants.\n\nThree of the factors/features in the above example are marked as\n‘personalisation features’ because they would change according to the user’s\nprevious order history and location. These will be the features that will be\ndifferent between Mila and Husain because of the differences in the restaurants\nand cuisines they have ordered from before in the past.\n\n> These personalisation features are at the crux of creating personalised\nexperiences for each user\nOther customer agnostic features/factors like the rating, price range, and\npopularity of the restaurant are also listed here. GoFood has millions of such\nexamples where users with different tastes made different decisions when shown a\nset of search results. These examples can now be used to create a dataset from\nwhich the learning to rank ML algorithm can create a model to decide how\nrelevant a GoFood user would find a restaurant given that user’s location, order\nhistory and other restaurant statistics.\n\nHow We Ranked\nOne way to approach this was as a point-wise ranking problem, wherein we try to\npredict the relevance judgement of each restaurant. Based on this, later we will\npredict the relevance judgement level and sort restaurants in decreasing order\nof predicted relevance score. This approach reduces learning to rank problem to\na regression problem.\n\nAnother approach was to solve it is a pairwise ranking problem, wherein the ML\nmodel is trying to learn how to get the order of a pair of restaurants correct\ni.e if Restaurant A is more preferable to Restaurant B , the order (Restaurant\nA, Restaurant B) is correct and the order (Restaurant B, Restaurant A) is wrong.\n\nFor an ML model to be learned, we need an objective function that captures this\npairwise ordering formulation . This is called a loss function or error function\nin ML and is the measure through which an ML model can assess how right or wrong\nits decision was. In pairwise ranking , this should be a function that becomes\nhigher whenever the model misjudges a preference order and becomes lower when it\nis right about the preference order.\n\nThe loss/error function C is explained below:\n\nWhen this function is minimised, the model is trying to predict a score for each\nrestaurant such that the ranking of the order of the restaurants are close the\nrelevance judgements the users made.\n\nThe pairwise formulation is a better approach here in comparison to the\npoint-wise approach as it is looking to get the order of restaurants right and\nis not trying to estimate the relevance score themselves whose values were\nassigned only as markers to show how some restaurants were more preferred\nrelative to others.\n\nWe used an implementation of the LambdaMART algorithm that learns to predict\nrelevance scores so as to minimise this pairwise loss. You can think of this as\na pursuit to find the decision tree that takes in all the parameters of the\nrestaurant and gives out a score to the restaurant . This score should be\nassigned in such a way as to make the pair orders right.\n\nOnce this model is trained, it can be used during search, as explained in this\npost\n[https://blog.gojekengineering.com/how-the-gojek-butler-serves-a-gourmet-meal-to-our-users-4a161d83052a?source=friends_link&sk=42397976fe914a418ac40f19545f90b7]\n.\n\nNow let’s go back to our beloved customers — Mila and Husain. The next time Mila\nor Husain looks for restaurants near them, the search results they see will be\naccording to their preferences. This is because the model would look at the\nnumber of times they have ordered from each of the restaurants near them before.\nIt would take their preferred cuisines and factors like restaurant ratings into\naccount, and show them the restaurants that they would prefer to order from\nfirst.\n\nThe different search results Mila and Husain get after learning to rank is used\nto re-rank the results are shown below.\n\nWe ran an AB test using this formulation of learning to rank and observed a\nrelative lift of 20% in search to ordering conversions and 23% improvement in\nNDCG. More information on how this metric is calculated here\n[https://blog.gojekengineering.com/is-this-what-you-were-looking-for-439bf012cca6?source=friends_link&sk=bdc1310acc3b6a8270f10284cb30fa53]\n.\n\nWhat We Learned\nOne interesting thing we observed as we started experimenting with this learning\nto rank model was personalising search results led to the average position at\nwhich the search to order conversions happen to be much higher on the list. This\nis because users were increasingly seeing the restaurants that they have some\naffinity towards and were able to make an ordering decision without scrolling\nmuch and without spending too much time being confused where to order from.\n\nSo that’s how we rank restaurant pairs with respect to relevance based on\navailable user data.

Thinking about burgers and crispy chicken fritters with creamy sauces sitting on a warm, soft bun? At least, that’s what I am thinking about. May be you’re different. Vegan perhaps? Or craving noodles? Each of us turn into a different person when we are hungry, and this is the story about how GoFood — Gojek’s food delivery service — helps you find the bite you crave.</p><blockquote><em><em>At the core of the food ordering experience, sits search.</em></em></blockquote><p>Searches are part of so many of our interactions on web and mobile, that we don’t even notice it anymore. This is mostly because modern search engines have matured to a point where they can deliver high quality results even if the entered query is a weak signal of the user’s intent. Even when weak, every query still contains a piece of the user’s intent.</p><p><em><em>In the case of GoFood, that piece is a fragment of our user’s hunger-driven brain.</em></em></p><p>In this post, we’ll discuss how we personalise the search results we surface on GoFood, based on the information we have about our users’ food preferences.</p><h1 id=\"how-each-of-us-differ\">How Each of Us Differ</h1><p>Let’s look at two of our GoFood users who have started feeling the pangs of hunger, and come online to check restaurants near them.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/3192/1*AP6fdakISbNOdEZyCUxa5g.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>They both open our app and click on the <code>NEAR ME</code> tile that lets users find the restaurants near them. We show them the nearest restaurants first, and this is what they both see.<br></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/2322/1*tBxtTKY9cfA7rcl5LXq3Ag.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>This list goes on and on and will let them see each restaurant which is farther and farther away. They can now peruse the menus of each restaurant and pick one that serves what they feel like ordering. The problem is that they may spend some time scrolling and then leave the app without being able to make up their minds around which restaurant to place an order from. We have thrown too many choices at them and the cognitive effort of picking a restaurant and then a dish from the menu is too much work to make them suffer through.</p><p><strong><strong><em><em>But wait. Both Mila and Husain have transacted with us in the past, and we know a fair bit about their preferences.</em></em> 🤔</strong></strong></p><p>To make this experience better, we decided to build a system that would let both of them see restaurants that suit their own tastes and preferences</p><h1 id=\"applying-machine-learning-to-the-problem\">Applying Machine Learning to the Problem</h1><p>Ranking documents for relevance works by assigning a prediction score to each document retrieved, which is directly proportional to its relevance. In the case of <code>NEAR ME</code> restaurant ranking this can be something like:</p><blockquote><em><em><em>Relevance score = 2 * (1/distance) + 1.2 * rating of restaurant</em></em></em></blockquote><p>Here in the relevance score calculation, we are taking weighted sum of different factors like <em><em>(1/distance) </em></em>and <em><em>rating of restaurant</em></em>. The coefficients/weights of these factors can be arrived at by experimenting with them and choosing weights that seem to maximise the ordering conversions. But, in the case of restaurant ranking in GoFood, we want to take into consideration many factors when deciding relevance. Unfortunately, experimenting with combinations of all those factors is impossible.</p><p>Enter L<em><em>earning to rank</em></em>. Here, the problem of deciding the rank of the restaurants shown to the user is formulated as a supervised machine learning problem.</p><p>If we look at past search, click, and ordering data, we will be able to assign relevance judgements to each restaurant listing according to whether our users clicked or ordered from one of those restaurants. Restaurants that attracted higher degrees of interest will be given higher degrees of relevance.</p><p>In the below example, a relevance judgement level of 0,1 and 2 is assigned to a restaurant according to whether the user viewed, clicked, or ordered from the restaurant in the search result. The relevance judgements are relative and only intent to be monotonically increasing with increasing relevance . They say that the restaurant which the user created an order from is more relevant than a restaurant the user merely checked out by clicking on it. <strong><strong>They don’t mean that the restaurant which received the order is twice as relevant .</strong></strong></p><p>The values of each of the factors that could have played a role in the user’s decision of clicking or ordering is also shown against the restaurants.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/2376/1*X0Oe0KA7ZTU2wYa2SXS_CA.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>Three of the factors/features in the above example are marked as ‘personalisation features’ because they would change according to the user’s previous order history and location. These will be the features that will be different between Mila and Husain because of the differences in the restaurants and cuisines they have ordered from before in the past.</p><blockquote>These personalisation features are at the crux of creating personalised experiences for each user</blockquote><p>Other customer agnostic features/factors like the rating, price range, and popularity of the restaurant are also listed here. GoFood has millions of such examples where users with different tastes made different decisions when shown a set of search results. These examples can now be used to create a dataset from which the learning to rank ML algorithm can create a model to decide how relevant a GoFood user would find a restaurant given that user’s location, order history and other restaurant statistics.</p><h1 id=\"how-we-ranked\">How We Ranked</h1><p>One way to approach this was as a point-wise ranking problem, wherein we try to predict the relevance judgement of each restaurant.

Since we built it, the adoption of Litmus across Gojek\nteams has been steadily increasing. More experiments are executed and more\nclients (in this case, Gojek teams) are integrated.\n\nBesides this, another requirement is to integrate Litmus with other backend\nservices directly, instead of solely with the mobile app. However, various\nclient backend services have their own SLA and most of them are linked to\nlatency. So, in order to client requirements, we have to reduce Litmus latency\nas much as possible.\n\nIn this post, we talk about our thought process behind delivering an initial\nsidecar design to achieve this goal,\n\nKnow your enemies\nFirst thing first, we needed to figure out where the bottleneck was. After\ndigging through some data, it turned out 30% of total time in a Litmus API call\nwas dominated by database call, and the number of database calls is ~2000 qps.\n\nBased on this fact, we decided to use cache. Now, we obviously could not use an\nexternal cache like Redis or Memcached. If we used those, we would be adding an\nadditional call. 😑\n\nInstead, we decided to use in-memory cache. Since Litmus was written in Clojure,\nwe went with caffeine cache [https://github.com/ben-manes/caffeine], which is\ngood enough to be used in JVM. We implemented the in-memory cache and the\ndatabase calls dropped from ~2000 qps to ~10 qps. The API latency also dropped\naround 10%.\n\nGood, but Not Good Enough. We Needed More.\nThe implementation of in-memory cache and further tinkering with Litmus\nprocesses would not be enough on their own. Our next approach was to reduce the\nhops between client and Litmus servers.\n\nHow? By moving Litmus server so it is geographically closer to the client?\n\n> Nah, we can do one better.\nWe pulled our Litmus server as close as possible to the backend service client.\nTo achieve this, we used sidecar pattern. We created a Litmus sidecar that\nresides in the same box as the backend service client. A Litmus sidecar can be\nseen as a mini version of the Litmus server that specifically serves the\ndedicated backend service client in the same box (VM).\n\nTweaking the Nuts and Bolts\nTo know how effective the sidecar pattern is, we need to know the base latency\nof Litmus server. We created 10 new active experiments specifically to get the\nbase latency number. With 20 concurrency and 10 request per second, the 99\npercentile was 23.55 ms.\n\nNeed faster API calls? Use gRPC\nWe used gRPC over REST wherever we could in our Litmus sidecar. gRPC also has\nvarious features such as push/pull streaming and client-side load balancing that\ncan be utilised for further enhancement. It’s fun stuff! 😁\n\nHow do we maintain our sidecar without permission to maintain the backend\nservice client box?\nIn Gojek, each team can only have permission to access its own components/boxes.\nIt is not possible (or scalable) to access all our backend service client boxes.\n\nWe could have considered this if we had only two or three clients. However, when\nyou’re building for an organisation of Gojek’s scale with the hope of having all\nteams adopt Litmus in their services, we couldn’t go down this route.\n\nOn the other hand, we still needed the ability to check the health of Litmus\nsidecars in every backend service client and develop a sidecar app that complies\nwith several 12 factor apps [https://12factor.net/] criteria (treat logs as\nevent streams and store config in the environment).\n\nSource\n[https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/24c41d54613afb774bff0a383043f8a47f4d0fd7/a14fb/static/img/consul-services.png]\nWe decided to use Consul for service discovery\n[https://www.consul.io/discovery.html] and key-value config\n[https://www.consul.io/docs/agent/kv.html]. In addition being easy to use and\nhaving a nice dashboard UI, Consul service discovery also supports health\nchecks.\n\nAfter we set up the infra (Consul server, agent, etc), we just needed to add our\nservice definition config along with our litmus sidecar to the backend service\nclient box. For the Consul KV itself, Consul supports hot reloading, which means\nwe don’t need to restart clients’ litmus sidecar if there are config changes.\n\nHowever, we needed to handle the logic of hot reloading in the litmus sidecar\napp by ourself. For the logging part, Gojek already has a logging tools called \nBarito\n[https://blog.gojekengineering.com/how-we-built-barito-to-enhance-logging-19f80b89496f] \nthat forwards the system logs so that we don’t have to access client boxes with\nssh.\n\nHere is the high-level architecture of how litmus sidecar integrates with client\nbackend services. Instead of pointing to Litmus server address, now backend\nservice clients only need to point to its localhost with Litmus sidecar port.\n\nLitmus sidecar in the same box as client backend serviceHow is the data\ndistributed?\nAs an agent of Litmus server that resides on the same box as the client, Litmus\nsidecar needs to have access to the same data as Litmus server.\n\n> This was something we discussed long and hard. The trade off between speed and\ndata consistency, the trade off between consistency and availability, and so on.\nAs our purpose was to reduce latency, speed became our first class citizen. At\nleast for now, it is okay for us to have eventually consistent data in our\nLitmus sidecar. We also decided to persist the data in the client box. We don’t\nstore all Litmus server data, only what the client needs.\n\nWe wanted our Litmus sidecar as light as possible, so it does not disturb the\nmain process in the box. Instead of using some SQL database, we decided to use\nKV store BadgerDB for persistence storage.\n\nHow to synchronise data between Litmus sidecar and server?\nWe came up with several ideas around this, but decided to use the simplest one\nfor our initial design. Litmus sidecar pulls the data that it needs periodically\nand persists it with BadgerDB.\n\nAlrighty then, let’s measure how good our sidecar is\nUsing the same setup as we did in measuring base latency, the 99 percentile\nlatency dropped to 6.91 ms. ✌\n\nNew clients are now integrating with sidecar, but we didn’t stop there. We are\ncontinuously optimising our Litmus sidecar app, and you can read more about our\nefforts in this post [http://bit.ly/2LQb6a3].\n\nSo, that was the thought process behind building sidecar to reduce latency.

Instead of pointing to Litmus server address, now backend service clients only need to point to its localhost with Litmus sidecar port.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://gojek-ghost.zysk.in/content/images/2020/05/1_nlCPCXxdSLGuXKvrjjBdfA.png\" class=\"kg-image\"><figcaption>Litmus sidecar in the same box as client backend service</figcaption></figure><h3 id=\"how-is-the-data-distributed\">How is the data distributed?</h3><p>As an agent of Litmus server that resides on the same box as the client, Litmus sidecar needs to have access to the same data as Litmus server.</p><blockquote><em><em>This was something we discussed long and hard. The trade off between speed and data consistency, the trade off between consistency and availability, and so on.</em></em></blockquote><p>As our purpose was to reduce latency, speed became our first class citizen. At least for now, it is okay for us to have eventually consistent data in our Litmus sidecar. We also decided to persist the data in the client box. We don’t store all Litmus server data, only what the client needs.</p><p>We wanted our Litmus sidecar as light as possible, so it does not disturb the main process in the box. Instead of using some SQL database, we decided to use KV store BadgerDB for persistence storage.</p><h3 id=\"how-to-synchronise-data-between-litmus-sidecar-and-server\">How to synchronise data between Litmus sidecar and server?</h3><p>We came up with several ideas around this, but decided to use the simplest one for our initial design. Litmus sidecar pulls the data that it needs periodically and persists it with BadgerDB.</p><h3 id=\"alrighty-then-let-s-measure-how-good-our-sidecar-is\">Alrighty then, let’s measure how good our sidecar is</h3><p>Using the same setup as we did in measuring base latency, the 99 percentile latency dropped to 6.91 ms. ✌</p><p>New clients are now integrating with sidecar, but we didn’t stop there. We are continuously optimising our Litmus sidecar app, and you can read more about our efforts in this <a href=\"http://bit.ly/2LQb6a3\" rel=\"noopener\">post</a>.</p><p>So, that was the thought process behind building sidecar to reduce latency. We believe there is still room for improvement, and would love to hear your thoughts in the comments.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://gojek-ghost.zysk.in/content/images/2020/05/1_Yigf1nGxRKjzV7vIC_YkYg-1.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>Want our stories sent straight to your inbox? <a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/go-jek/gojek-tech-newsletter\" rel=\"noopener\">Sign up for our newsletter!</a></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://gojek-ghost.zysk.in/content/images/2020/05/1_XSAkmYAomyHp6_18rjjAfA-1.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\"><figcaption><a href=\"http://bit.ly/2KslIe4\">gojek.jobs</a></figcaption></figure>","url":"https://gojek-ghost.zysk.in/reducing-latency-with-sidecar/","canonical_url":null,"uuid":"fad08e62-a341-4366-b20c-ae2c5c5f487d","page":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_styles":null,"comment_id":"5ecb637d7aa22c4066f83f36","reading_time":5}}]},"tags":{"edges":[{"node":{"name":"Culture","slug":"culture"}},{"node":{"name":"Data","slug":"data"}},{"node":{"name":"Design","slug":"design"}},{"node":{"name":"News","slug":"news"}},{"node":{"name":"Stories","slug":"stories"}},{"node":{"name":"Tech","slug":"tech"}}]}},"pageContext":{"pageNumber":0,"humanPageNumber":1,"skip":0,"limit":12,"numberOfPages":4,"previousPagePath":"","nextPagePath":"/page/2"}}}
