As we spread out from Jakarta,\nsatiating the hunger of millions of customers in most parts of Indonesia, GoFood\nas a product got increasingly complicated. Orders started to pile up, and we\nwere struggling to keep up with the skyrocketing demand. If we wanted to keep up\nwith users‚Äô expectations, a few things needed to be done. We had to change, and\nsimultaneously up our game.\n\nIt‚Äôs a VUCA world, and we often remind ourselves that not a lot of things are\nconstant. We‚Äôve been working hard to reimagine, re-engineer and redesign the\nGoFood flow which hasn‚Äôt been altered too much for many years.\n\nTo help you understand how it all started, let‚Äôs take you back in time a little\nbit‚Ä¶\n\nWhen the Gojek app for ride-hailing was launched in early 2015, we noticed there\nwere times when our driver partners had lean work periods. To provide additional\nmeans to help them make use of this time and earn more, GoSend (to send\ncouriers) and GoShop (to buy anything) were launched as auxiliary services.\n\n> We noticed that majority of orders placed in GoShop were for food. This gave way\nto GoFood, our dedicated food delivery product, launched in mid-2015.\nPhase 1: Listing Model\nGoFood started as a concierge model, where we had no tie-ups with restaurants. A\nSalesforce was deployed to list as many restaurant menus as possible on our\nplatform. When a customer placed an order, it would be assigned to one of our\ndriver partners, who would then go and place the order at the restaurant. The\ndriver partner would wait around, and when the order was ready, pay in cash,\npickup the order and deliver it to the customer.\n\nTedious? Yes. Scalable? No. ü§∑‚Äç\n\n\nPhase 2: Partnering With Merchants\nTo arrive at a scalable solution, we realised we had to take the restaurant\nmerchants along with us in this journey and welcome them into our ecosystem. We\nstarted partnering with the merchants, who were known as ‚ÄòGoFood Partners‚Äô.\n\n> This not only helped our merchants grow their businesses, but also got ample\nvisibility boost on GoFood.\nEven after onboarding them into our ecosystem, a large part of the process was\nmanual. It was far from ideal because there was no record of transactions\nbesides a booking on GoFood and a receipt handed to the driver partner.\n\nOften there were discrepancies in the number of orders assigned and the number\nof orders completed. How, you ask?\n\nImagine a GoFood partner who is part of a large chain of restaurants. When\nsomeone orders food from this chain, GoFood assigns this order to one outlet.\nHowever, the driver partner may decide to visit another outlet and pick up the\norder, as per convenience.\n\nThere were more problems galore.\n\nIf a merchant partner was not open for business on a particular day, and wanted\nto update their menu, or indicate items as out of stock, they had to call the\nGojek Customer Care. During this time, orders would still be coming in, which\nresulted in driver partners accepting orders that most certainly couldn‚Äôt be\ncompleted without a hassle.\n\nThere was a lot that needed fixing here, and it could only be done by\nintegrating merchants more deeply into our ecosystem. So, that‚Äôs exactly what we\ndid.\n\nPhase 3: The merchant app, GoResto\nTowards the end of 2016, a concept was developed for an app that would cater to\nmerchant partners, and by early 2017 GoResto (which is what we called it at the\ntime) was ready.\n\nWe introduced the following in GoResto:\n\n1. Electronic payments\nAll of Gojek‚Äôs driver partners had GoPay e-wallets associated with their\naccounts. With GoResto, we did the same for our GoFood partners. Transactions\nbetween driver and GoFood partners was directly wallet-to-wallet, hence,\ncashless.\n\n2. PIN exchange for restaurant verification\nTo ensure the order is secured, driver partners would also need to share a PIN\nwith the merchant while picking up the order. This electronic handshake helped\nus verify they were indeed picking up the right order from the right outlet.\n\n3. Catalog management\nWe noticed a lot of cancellations were happening because the items were either\nout of stock, restaurants were closed or customers were generally skeptical\nabout ordering dishes that didn‚Äôt have enough reference images. So, we started\nfocussing more on improving the product experience for our customers and BCR\n(booking completion rate). Catalog management was introduced so that the\nmerchants could regularly update details that customers saw on GoFood. For\nexample: Availability status of dishes that were put on the menu, uploading\ndetails pertaining to different items sold, etc.\n\nIn the meanwhile, GoResto was rebranded to GoBiz. What started off as a product\nthat helped merchants to manage their food orders, started evolving into\nsomething bigger. Since the scope extended beyond GoFood, calling it ‚ÄòGoResto‚Äô\nmade no sense.\n\nThe rebranding came with enhanced features in GoBiz. As you might‚Äôve guessed, it\nalso came with new, enhanced problems and a sub-optimal flow:\n\n‚ö†Ô∏è The driver partner was ready, but the food wasn‚Äôt\n> The average time taken for a driver partner was:\n~9 minutes to pick up an order\n~19 minutes to deliver the order\nA portion of this time was spent by the driver waiting for the food to be\nprepared, because in most cases, GoFood partners started preparing food only\nafter the driver arrived! This was mostly because customer would add more food\nitems or the ordered items would be out of stock. We figured that the driver\narrival time could be parallelised with the food prep time. This led to 2\nimportant things:\n\n * Overall delivery time for the customer could be reduced\n * Wait time for the driver could be utilised to fulfil other orders\n\nÔ∏èÔ∏èÔ∏è‚ö†Ô∏è GoFood Partner-driven cancellations existed, accountability didn‚Äôt\nGoFood partners had the ability to set their open hours and change item\navailability, but they didn‚Äôt always keep it updated. When cancellations\npertaining to these reasons happened, they were handled by‚Ä¶the driver partners.\nü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è\nThis meant, the orders had to be cancelled either by the driver partners or the\ncustomers themselves.\n\n> Items being out of stock or restaurants being closed accounted for over 35% of\nall customer cancellations after a driver was assigned.\nOn the driver side, these accounted for over 75% of all driver cancellations. üòì\n‚ö†Ô∏è Price edits became pricey\nIn this order flow, the driver placed the final order with the merchant. This\nessentially means that the original order placed by the customer could be\nmodified due to various reasons: Incorrect listing of price, unavailability of\nitems, adding new items to the order, etc. To accommodate these cases, drivers\nwere allowed to input to final price of the order, leading to a price edit.\n\nAnd price edits aren‚Äôt uncommon. They happen to ~34% of the orders.\n\nMultiple moving pieces exposed these orders to skip payments or consumer wallet\nsweeps.\n\nPhase 4: Introducing Merchant Acceptance Flow\nDue to various reasons, our driver partners were handling GoFood partner-driven\ncancellations and heavy-lifting to ensure the orders were fulfilled. This, too,\nhad to change.\n\nAfter brainstorming, mind-mapping and head-scratching, we arrived at Merchant\nAccept Flow (MAF). The merchants who are onboarded to MAF are called Super\nPartners. The solution lets our Super Partners accept/reject orders based on the\nrestaurant being open, availability of items, or any other factors that\ndetermine order fulfilment or cancellation. This in turn helps our customers and\ndriver partners know that the merchant is preparing food for sure, so that there\nare no customer or driver cancellations.\n\nIn Part-2 of this blog, we‚Äôll dive deep into Merchant Acceptance Flow, how we\nwent about designing it and introducing Super Partners to our customers.
