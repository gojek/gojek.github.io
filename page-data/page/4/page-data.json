Every module or class should do one thing, and do it well.\nWe found this principle was applicable, and incredibly important, while\ndesigning our systems.\n\nAbout a year ago, we released a new chat service (which we internally called \nIcebreaker). It allowed our users to communicate with drivers through the app\nitself, rather than use SMS (which cost both the driver and customer money).\n\nHowever, all was not well. For numerous reasons, the service gave us a lot of\nissues and late night pagers. This post details the lessons we learnt, and some\nof the decisions we took to make this service more reliable.\n\nThe Problem(s)\nIn a nutshell, Icebreaker depended on too many other services to function\nproperly. Let’s look at some of the tasks Icebreaker performed in order to\ncreate a channel:\n\n 1. Authorise the API call: This made a call to our authentication service.\n 2. Fetch the customer profile: This required an HTTP call to our customer\n    service.\n 3. Fetch the drivers’ profile: This required an HTTP call to our driver\n    service.\n 4. Verify if the customer-driver pair are in an active order: This made a call\n    to our active booking storage service.\n 5. Create the channel.\n\nIf any of these services failed, Icebreaker would fail as well.\n\nSimultaneous dependence on multiple services ensures that the dependent service\nis less stable than any of themEven if we could ensure 99% uptime for all\nservices in question, that still means the chances of all of them being up at\nthe same time was 96%.\n\nP(icebreaker active) = P(customer service active) * P(driver service active) *\nP(authentication service active) * P(active booking storage active) = 0.99 *\n0.99 * 0.99 * 0.99 ~= 0.96\n\nThis means our downtime has increased four times over (4%, as opposed to 1%).\n\nNot my job\nWhen a service starts to do too many things, it’s bound to fail sooner or later.\nIn this case, Icebreaker’s job was to create a channel between a customer and a\ndriver. However, it was doing all this extra stuff: like authentication,\nverification, and profile retrieval. 🤦‍♂\n\nLet’s take a look at the changes we made to get rid of each dependency:\n\nAuthentication\nEvery API call arriving to Icebreaker came with an API token which needed\nauthentication. To solve this, we added a Kong [https://konghq.com/] API\ngateway. This authenticated all requests and added information about the\nauthenticated user within the API headers.\n\nNow, every request arriving to Icebreaker was authenticated.\n\n> Key takeaway: Tell, don’t ask. The requests coming from the API gateway told the\nservice that they were authenticated, rather than Icebreaker having to ask\nanother service.\nProfile retrieval\nIn order to create a channel, we needed a piece of information called the ‘chat\ntoken’ for each user. This was stored in the customer service for the customer,\nand the driver service for the driver.\n\nSince Icebreaker was the only service using this token, we moved these tokens to\nit, and removed them from the customer and driver services.\n\nNow,Icebreaker had all the information it needed in its own database, which was\na more reliable source of truth as compared to a whole other HTTP service.\n\n> Key takeaway: If your service is the only one using any piece of information, it\nshould reside within the service itself\nActive booking storage\nIcebreaker used to create a channel on-demand every time the user hit its\nchannel creation API. This on-demand creation required us to verify that an\nactive booking existed, for which the user needed to create a channel. After\nall, it didn’t make sense to create a channel when the parties involved did not\nhave an order with each other.\n\nTo fix this, we moved to an asynchronous architecture for channel creation.\nInstead of on-demand channel creation, we made use of GO-JEKs data pipeline\n[https://blog.gojekengineering.com/data-infrastructure-at-go-jek-cd4dc8cbd929],\nthat published events every time a booking was made. Icebreaker now consisted of\ntwo components: the worker and the server.\n\n 1. The worker consumed booking events every time they were made. It then\n    created a channel between the customer and driver in the booking, and stored\n    the channel information on a Redis cache.\n 2. The server served channel creation requests as before. Only, this time, the\n    channels were already created and cached, along with the order number.\n    \n\nSo, instead of on demand channel creation, the channels were created and stored\nbeforehand. Since we were consuming booking events from our own data pipeline,\nthere was no need to verify whether the booking was genuine or not.\n\n> Key takeaway: Again, tell, don’t ask. The events coming from our data pipeline\ntold Icebreaker that the bookings were genuine. This meant it could create the\nchannel, instead of hitting a service to verify the authenticity of the booking.\nResults\nNow Icebreaker did only what it was truly meant to do: create channels.\n\nSince we removed dependencies on most external systems, we no longer had to\nworry about one system failure causing Icebraker to malfunction. The load on the\nexternal services also reduced, since Icebreaker was no longer using their\nendpoints for channel creation.\n\nMoving to the asynchronous architecture also led to a drastic reduction in\nresponse time, from ~200ms to ~10ms, since we were pre-creating and caching\nchannels for every order.\n\nThe takeaways we got from this experience conform with the single responsibility\nprinciple. In the end, it’s always better to ask ourselves: “Can this service do\nless?”\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWant our stories in your inbox?

This was stored in the customer service for the customer, and the driver service for the driver.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1634/1*dKBOVH4ODILeTSqgQIazcw.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>Since Icebreaker was the only service using this token, we moved these tokens to it, and removed them from the customer and driver services.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1634/1*eXYrRFGNnEPqv0nvbwjbIA.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>Now,Icebreaker had all the information it needed in its own database, which was a more reliable source of truth as compared to a whole other HTTP service.</p><blockquote><em><em><strong><strong><em>Key takeaway</em></strong></strong><em>: </em><em>If your service is the only one using any piece of information, it should reside within the service itself</em></em></em></blockquote><h1 id=\"active-booking-storage\">Active booking storage</h1><p>Icebreaker used to create a channel on-demand every time the user hit its channel creation API. This on-demand creation required us to verify that an active booking existed, for which the user needed to create a channel. After all, it didn’t make sense to create a channel when the parties involved did not have an order with each other.</p><p>To fix this, we moved to an asynchronous architecture for channel creation. Instead of on-demand channel creation, we made use of GO-JEKs <a href=\"https://blog.gojekengineering.com/data-infrastructure-at-go-jek-cd4dc8cbd929\" rel=\"noopener\">data pipeline</a>, that published events every time a booking was made. <strong><strong>Icebreaker now consisted of two components: the worker and the server.</strong></strong></p><ol><li>The worker consumed booking events every time they were made. It then created a channel between the customer and driver in the booking, and stored the channel information on a Redis cache.</li><li>The server served channel creation requests as before. Only, this time, the channels were already created and cached, along with the order number.<br></li></ol><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/3283/1*hNR_iSrTKkyvUhwMviHX_g.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>So, instead of on demand channel creation, the channels were created and stored beforehand. Since we were consuming booking events from our own data pipeline, there was no need to verify whether the booking was genuine or not.</p><blockquote><em><em><strong><strong><em>Key takeaway</em></strong></strong><em>: Again, tell, don’t ask. The events coming from our data pipeline told Icebreaker that the bookings were genuine. This meant it could create the channel, instead of hitting a service to verify the authenticity of the booking.</em></em></em></blockquote><h1 id=\"results\">Results</h1><p>Now Icebreaker did only what it was truly meant to do: create channels.</p><p>Since we removed dependencies on most external systems, we no longer had to worry about one system failure causing Icebraker to malfunction. The load on the external services also reduced, since Icebreaker was no longer using their endpoints for channel creation.</p><p>Moving to the asynchronous architecture also led to a drastic reduction in response time, from ~200ms to ~10ms, since we were pre-creating and caching channels for every order.</p><p>The takeaways we got from this experience conform with the single responsibility principle. In the end, it’s always better to ask ourselves: <strong><strong><em><em>“Can this service do less?”</em></em></strong></strong></p><hr><p>Want our stories in your inbox? <a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/go-jek/gojek-tech-newsletter\">Sign up for our newsletter!</a><br></p>","url":"https://gojek-ghost.zysk.in/applying-the-single-responsibility-principle-to-microservices/","canonical_url":null,"uuid":"8bb46a92-34cc-4bf4-a26e-65dc26a77873","page":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_styles":null,"comment_id":"5ec2af8a7aa22c4066f83abe","reading_time":4}},{"node":{"id":"Ghost__Post__5eb12c67f7c7da001effcdd8","title":"How Gojek Manages 1 Million Drivers With 12 Engineers (Part 2)","slug":"how-gojek-manages-1-million-drivers-with-12-engineers-part-2","featured":false,"feature_image":"https://res-1.cloudinary.com/hcq4cvthp/image/upload/q_auto/v1/ghost-blog-images/1_dWQkpxR4YJawDR4G6JgYFw.jpg","excerpt":"An overburdened codebase, an updated tech stack, a big rewrite— how a lean team built the foundation for a Super App","custom_excerpt":"An overburdened codebase, an updated tech stack, a big rewrite— how a lean team built the foundation for a Super App","visibility":"public","created_at_pretty":"05 May, 2020","published_at_pretty":"02 July, 2018","updated_at_pretty":"12 May, 2020","created_at":"2020-05-05T14:35:43.000+05:30","published_at":"2018-07-02T09:30:00.000+05:30","updated_at":"2020-05-12T11:57:24.000+05:30","meta_title":null,"meta_description":"An overburdened codebase, an updated tech stack, a big rewrite— how a lean team built the foundation for a Super App","og_description":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"authors":[{"name":"Gojek","slug":"gojek","bio":"Gojek is a Super App. It’s one app for ordering food, commuting, digital payments, shopping, hyper-local delivery, and two dozen services.","profile_image":"https://gojek-ghost.zysk.in/content/images/2020/05/logo-01-1.png","twitter":"@gojektech","facebook":"gojektech","website":"https://www.gojek.io"}],"primary_author":{"name":"Gojek","slug":"gojek","bio":"Gojek is a Super App. It’s one app for ordering food, commuting, digital payments, shopping, hyper-local delivery, and two dozen services.","profile_image":"https://gojek-ghost.zysk.in/content/images/2020/05/logo-01-1.png","twitter":"@gojektech","facebook":"gojektech","website":"https://www.gojek.io"},"primary_tag":{"name":"Stories","slug":"stories","description":"Deep dives into high-impact initiatives and products that helped Gojek create significant impact.","feature_image":null,"meta_description":null,"meta_title":null,"visibility":"public"},"tags":[{"name":"Stories","slug":"stories","description":"Deep dives into high-impact initiatives and products that helped Gojek create significant impact.","feature_image":null,"meta_description":null,"meta_title":null,"visibility":"public"}],"plaintext":"By Adithya Venkatesan\n\nThis is Part 2 of a feature story profiling the ‘Allocations’ team at GOJEK.

And just when you think it’s done, there’s another layer. For\nthe next 3 months, it was onion after onion, layer after layer across teams at\nGOJEK. Downtimes were the new normal by the beginning of 2016.\n\nBack to square one.\n\nThe ‘Broadcast algorithm’ the bid engine team was relying on was failing. But\nhow?\n\nEvery driver was seeing the same order multiple times. The algorithm\n‘broadcasted’ the same order across its driver database. So if there were 100\norders in a specific area and 200 drivers, each driver would see the order, but\nnot necessarily be able to fulfil it. There was a three-fold problem to the\nalgorithm: Accountability, High-concurrency and promoting Unhealthy competition.\n\nAccountability: How can we reward the drivers who are doing more orders, zero\ncancellations etc… when he/she simply couldn’t accept the order? How can we deny\nbonus, because by design, a driver was not getting an order due to a dozen\nreasons? There was no accountability for the driver, or the business\nfundamentals.\n\nHigh-concurrency: The sheer volume of orders meant drivers were missing out on\norders because it was blasted across phones. Some orders were not being\nfulfilled because of multiple blasts and server loads. More orders, less drivers\n= some orders not being fulfilled, which resulted in a poor customer experience.\n\nNote: The location-based orders are a peculiar problem for GOJEK.\n\n> Why? In a distance of 20metres, you’ll spot more than 30+ GO-RIDE scooters, as\nopposed to maybe a maximum of 10 cars.\nUnhealthy competition: Once you’re blasting an order to all, you’re not\nfactoring in quality drivers for customers. We were also not getting the nearest\ndriver for an order. This breeds unhealthy competitiveness among drivers.\n\nThere is an adequate probability of doubt in the nature the algorithm was\ndesigned, and other constraints that are outside of the realm. Who gets the\norder became a function of the phone — better GPS, hardware, Internet, software;\nall played a critical portion. And that was unfair. So zero accountability and\nhigh congestion of drivers meant things were going awry.\n\n10x growth, 100% failure\nWhen Niranjan [https://twitter.com/niranjan_p] pulled a couple of all nighters\n[https://blog.gojekengineering.com/how-go-jek-manages-1-million-drivers-with-12-engineers-part-1-978af9ccfd32] \nand and rewrote the code, the core portion was rewritten to make it a SPIKE.\nWhat is a spike? You break the rules and throw caution to the air with the\nobjective of shipping something out to keep the company afloat. The problem with\nSPIKE is that it wasn’t the end-solution. And that meant more downtimes and more\nfailures. But, the team was in murky waters by late 2015.\n\nAt this point, GOJEK was managing 300,000+ orders every day. Failures were\nroutine. Again. Wherever Nadiem went, he was questioned on why the app was\ncrashing or users could simply not find customers. At this point, the tech team\nwas made up of around 10 people, who were firefighting every day. When Shobhit\n[https://medium.com/u/e5f92a17704d?source=post_page-----35f6a27a0faf----------------------]\n, one of our star programmers, went to a Domino’s store nearby to grab a quick\nbite, drivers started questioning him. Anyone who wore a GOJEK T-shirt became\nthe unofficial complaint box. Something needed to change, and fast.\n\nThis was again an underestimation of how much Indonesians relied on GOJEK.\nEveryone wanted to use GOJEK. It made life easier in the traffic-congested glut\nthat was Indonesia. Importantly, jobs and lives depended on it.\n\nDecisions…\n\nNadiem’s internal mail> “No project has a budget and impact as big as this in\nGOJEK’s history”\nThe big rewrite — The Perfect Allocation\nThe team needed to work on a different algorithm: 1–1 personalisation, pin\naccountability on drivers, identify what a perfect driver looks like, and ideate\non how to frame this persona. The big rewrite began in the middle of 2016. The\n‘bid engine’ team was now rechristened as the ‘Allocations’ team. At this point,\nwe were still losing customers. There were leaky faucets that were not sealed.\nAfter all, the work of the Allocations team criss-crossed all of GOJEK’s\nproducts and services. It was time to revisit the mothership.\n\nHello Clojure.\n\nBack to square one. Back to taking risks. By now, the core team was all too\nfamiliar with handling high-pressure timelines and live codebases. Clojure was\nan obvious choice because of the specific complexities it intended to solve.\n\n> “Only two in the team knew Clojure then, but it solved an important business\nproblem. We went with it and we all had to learn. Back to school. Again.” — \nNiranjan Paranjape\n[https://medium.com/u/689ebe477c46?source=post_page-----35f6a27a0faf----------------------]\nThe first task was to replicate the bid engine logic. A 6-member team got to\nwork with Clojure. Why Clojure? Because the language designs better abstractions\nfor a specific problem the team needed to solve. While Golang was the modern\nsuperbike that had it all, Clojure was the cruiser — really simple and capable\nof designing complex code. Clojure ushered this idea of getting organised and\nensuring good software development practices.\n\nOn the left, you see the Allocation code in Go. On the right, the exact same\ncode in Clojure.\n\nThis is not to state one language is better than the other. It’s tempting to\narrive at that conclusion when you see the image above. There were trade-offs\nmade when the switch was made. While Go is superior in performance, the\ncapability to make changes and add features was hard. Language was traded for\ndesign.\n\nThe innate abstraction to sniff out what works when, how and why is what makes\nlean engineering so special at GOJEK.\n\n“The more boring a rewrite is, the sweeter the success,” — Shobhit\n[https://medium.com/u/e5f92a17704d?source=post_page-----35f6a27a0faf----------------------]\n. After the 2-month long big rewrite, a stable product was live. Pause. Breathe.\nAfter 3 days of releasing, no one noticed there was a new codebase/algorithm in\nplace. That’s what success tastes like. Smooth as butter. No issues and\nachieving scale.\n\nShaping a mindset\nThat’s half the story told. A million mistakes later, we’re still making\nmistakes. But that’s the good part. We fail fast. We build fast. No hierarchy. \nThere’s an ingrained mentality of managing more with less. Anything that’s\nrepetitive gets automated. One could argue this was born out of the desperation\nof GOJEK products being the arteries criss-crossing through the heart of\nIndonesia. Regardless, the engineering psyche was passed down and filters\nthrough our recruitment. Here’s a reckoner on why GOJEK is hard to get into and\nequally hard to abandon.\n[https://medium.com/gojekengineering/why-we-ask-for-code-b276b45ea790]\n\nThe simplification of the story would merely state the Allocation team allocates\ndrivers to customers. But their genesis is filled with fascinating engineering\ninsights. How do you factor supply and demand, how do you reward drivers, manage\ndriver health by reducing the workload, figure surge pricing, check for\nloopholes, and so on. Each function has dozens of people in similar startups at\nGOJEK’s scale. We are able to cut this down because of our emphasis on lean\nengineering. We don’t make compromises on our recruitment either. Leaders code.\nEveryone codes.\n\nEngineers are running their own startups in a startup. GOJEK is creating a one\nof a kind Super App with a platform for other startups to be part of\n\nToday, anyone within a 300-meter range can grab a ride. That’s only an average.\nIn popular malls near Jakarta, there are drivers every 10 metres or lesser. Then\ncame dashboards and data to crunch driver statistics, daily research to tweak\nthe algorithm. The last time I checked, GOJEK does more than 35+ orders each\nsecond across our services like GO-FOOD, GO-SEND, GO-MASSAGE etc…\n\nThe ship of Theseus\nYou use a really old car to commute to office. It breaks, stutters and sometimes\nrefuses to move entirely. You can’t scrap it because it’s the only car you have.\nBut you want a supercar. So you go about buying the steering wheel and fixing it\nto the old car. Then comes the rims, the music system, leather seats and slowly,\nthe car begins to take shape. But it still has components of nostalgia; the car\nthat ferried you in dark times when nothing else would. Stan Marsh is that old\ncar.\n\nRemember Stan Marsh? The old legacy code on which GOJEK was being built?\n\n10% of Stan Marsh survives. Even till date. (There is a plan to eventually put\nit to bed [https://blog.gojekengineering.com/thank-you-stan-marsh-29db553544bf])\nIt’s there for legacy reasons. I suspect the team is also sentimental about it.\nThink of it as the ‘Ship of Theseus’ conundrum. No matter what engineers who\njoin GOJEK think of Stan Marsh, it was the foundation on which GOJEK was built.\nSmart engineering is also about working with a legacy codebase and improving it.\nFly with what you have and make it better. Everything else will follow. The team\nembraced that challenge.\n\nIt all boils down to the kind of people you let in the system. People are\nempowered to make decisions at GOJEK. As our India Head, Sidu Ponnappa\n[https://medium.com/u/e2e244e6c6b3?source=post_page-----35f6a27a0faf----------------------] \noften repeats, “Don’t throw people at a problem.” It’s a typical outsourcing\nmindset Indian Engineers have been cajoled into. More people does not mean\nbetter work. More people does not mean better code. If that were true, GOJEK\nsimply wouldn’t exist today doing more than a 100 million+ orders a month with a\npaltry 200+ engineers.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nStory credits: Shobhit Srivastava\n[https://medium.com/u/e5f92a17704d?source=post_page-----35f6a27a0faf----------------------]\n, Ranjeet Singh\n[https://medium.com/u/710d3b419a5a?source=post_page-----35f6a27a0faf----------------------]\n, Mehakdeep Singh\n[https://medium.com/u/36ce12a82c52?source=post_page-----35f6a27a0faf----------------------]\n, Bergas Bimo Branarto\n[https://medium.com/u/5cffcceadf08?source=post_page-----35f6a27a0faf----------------------]\n.","html":"<p>By Adithya Venkatesan</p><p>This is Part 2 of a feature story profiling the ‘Allocations’ team at GOJEK.

If that were true, GOJEK simply wouldn’t exist today doing more than a 100 million+ orders a month with a paltry 200+ engineers.</p><hr><p>Story credits: <a href=\"https://medium.com/u/e5f92a17704d?source=post_page-----35f6a27a0faf----------------------\" rel=\"noopener\">Shobhit Srivastava</a>, <a href=\"https://medium.com/u/710d3b419a5a?source=post_page-----35f6a27a0faf----------------------\" rel=\"noopener\">Ranjeet Singh</a>, <a href=\"https://medium.com/u/36ce12a82c52?source=post_page-----35f6a27a0faf----------------------\" rel=\"noopener\">Mehakdeep Singh</a>, <a href=\"https://medium.com/u/5cffcceadf08?source=post_page-----35f6a27a0faf----------------------\" rel=\"noopener\">Bergas Bimo Branarto</a>.</p>","url":"https://gojek-ghost.zysk.in/how-gojek-manages-1-million-drivers-with-12-engineers-part-2/","canonical_url":null,"uuid":"b71c3dd0-28bd-4805-8af7-6071c17748f3","page":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_styles":null,"comment_id":"5eb12c67f7c7da001effcdd8","reading_time":7}},{"node":{"id":"Ghost__Post__5eb12b71f7c7da001effcdbe","title":"How Gojek Manages 1 million Drivers With 12 Engineers (Part 1)","slug":"how-gojek-manages-1-million-drivers-with-12-engineers-part-1","featured":true,"feature_image":"https://res-3.cloudinary.com/hcq4cvthp/image/upload/q_auto/v1/ghost-blog-images/1_0G01nMPD--K_MrKhhkurtw.jpg","excerpt":"The story of GOJEK’s first ever team, and consequently, the psyche of how 200 engineers run a Super App of 18+ products.","custom_excerpt":"The story of GOJEK’s first ever team, and consequently, the psyche of how 200 engineers run a Super App of 18+ products.","visibility":"public","created_at_pretty":"05 May, 2020","published_at_pretty":"24 May, 2018","updated_at_pretty":"12 May, 2020","created_at":"2020-05-05T14:31:37.000+05:30","published_at":"2018-05-24T09:30:00.000+05:30","updated_at":"2020-05-12T11:57:36.000+05:30","meta_title":null,"meta_description":"The story of GOJEK’s first ever team, and consequently, the psyche of how 200 engineers run a Super App of 18+ products.","og_description":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"authors":[{"name":"Gojek","slug":"gojek","bio":"Gojek is a Super App. It’s one app for ordering food, commuting, digital payments, shopping, hyper-local delivery, and two dozen services.","profile_image":"https://gojek-ghost.zysk.in/content/images/2020/05/logo-01-1.png","twitter":"@gojektech","facebook":"gojektech","website":"https://www.gojek.io"}],"primary_author":{"name":"Gojek","slug":"gojek","bio":"Gojek is a Super App. It’s one app for ordering food, commuting, digital payments, shopping, hyper-local delivery, and two dozen services.","profile_image":"https://gojek-ghost.zysk.in/content/images/2020/05/logo-01-1.png","twitter":"@gojektech","facebook":"gojektech","website":"https://www.gojek.io"},"primary_tag":{"name":"Stories","slug":"stories","description":"Deep dives into high-impact initiatives and products that helped Gojek create significant impact.","feature_image":null,"meta_description":null,"meta_title":null,"visibility":"public"},"tags":[{"name":"Stories","slug":"stories","description":"Deep dives into high-impact initiatives and products that helped Gojek create significant impact.","feature_image":null,"meta_description":null,"meta_title":null,"visibility":"public"}],"plaintext":"By Adithya Venkatesan\n\nIn Norse mythology, Yggdrasil is a gigantic mythical tree that connects the nine\nworlds of Norse cosmology.

While it is extremely rewarding, it is also\nchallenging. This is because we often work on tough problems with no clear\nsolution — which involves taking risks and learning things on the fly.\n\nAll this, while competing with the best in the industry.\n\nThat’s why our guiding principles serve as a great reference point to deal with\nsituations that arise every day. Here are some that we abide by:\n\nEveryone writes code — At Gojek, we believe that Software\nPrincipals/Architects/Engineers can only do the right thing when they work on\ncode themselves. It’s the only way to decide what’s working and what’s not. We\ndon’t believe that software requires a 50,000 foot overview with people\nexclusively working on the blueprint. At Gojek, writing software is not a\nlow-level task; it’s at the very core of what we do.\n\nLeaders who code are better judges of technical skill.\n\nEveryone needs to ‘walk the talk’ — We respect people who get down in the\ntrenches and take a hands-on approach to problem solving. Based on our\nexperience, standing at a distance and issuing commandments has many a time been\ninefficient and error prone, and hence we avoid this.\n\nLeaders are grown and not made — We believe in acquired respect and leadership,\nnot leadership by position. At Gojek, you earn your leadership mettle. We\nbelieve in helping our people grow into leadership roles by giving them chances,\nrisk appetite and freedom. We trust our people and support them to do the right\nthing at any given moment. In my own career, I’ve been privileged enough to have\nfound some amazing mentors, and I am glad to be able to continue the legacy at\nGojek.\n\nEvery decision is correct at the time it is made — Swift decision-making is\nextremely important in a fast paced environment like ours. Once a decision is\nmade, we don’t constantly agonise over it or second guess. We trust that\nwhenever someone makes a decision, it is the right one, given the information\navailable to them at that time. Only the passage of time can tell us whether a\nparticular decision was right or wrong. It’s OK to change decisions, and we\nencourage people to not be afraid to make a decision.\n\nEvery person has some strengths, even if we don’t always see them — A great team\nis built with a group of people who have complementary skill sets. A combination\nof different strengths make teams that can tackle all kinds of situations. At\nGojek, we believe each one of us is unique and has unique strengths. It’s just a\nmatter of finding the right role to match the skills. Teams become super strong\nwhen they appreciate each other’s strengths.\n\nWorking in tech means learning all the time — Learning is important in every\nfield. In the technology industry, it is a matter of life and death. Technology\nis changing all the time, what worked a decade ago may be completely obsolete\nnow. For example, practices that worked in Waterfall don’t work in Agile, and\nuser experiences on mobile apps were unimaginable a few years back. So, we\nconstantly look for and admire people who are curious and willing to learn.\n\nThe best part? Such people will always hire people they can learn from!\n\nPair Programming and Test-Driven Development (TDD) work — If they didn’t, our\nteams wouldn’t exist.
