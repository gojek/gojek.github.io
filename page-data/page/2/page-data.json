This allows users to have\nconversations with:\n\n * The currently assigned driver partner in relation to a booking.\n * Other Gojek users, provided they are known contacts in your address book.\n   These can be either personal or group chats.\n\nIn order to use the chat platform as springboard to other services within\nGojek’s vast ecosystem, we wanted to expose some features that integrate with\nour other offerings — within the convenience of a chat window.\n\nOne of the first service options we wanted to focus on was payments — paying and\nrequesting for money between individuals and groups. Chat had the platform to\ncreate connections between people, GoPay had payments — it was time to marry the\ntwo.\n\nArchitecture\nTo start with, as a chat platform team, we did not really know anything about\nthe payments domain. In fact, most of the integrations we planned for required\ncollaborating with other product teams within Gojek.\n\nWe decided early on that we needed a plugin-based framework that other product\nteams (and even chat team’s core services) could use. We also decided that the\nAPI surface area for this new framework should have as much as possible in\ncommon between the Android and iOS implementations.\n\nThe first use case we focused on was integrating payment options within chat —\nwhich would help us kickstart our design and feature rollout.\n\nApproach\nIn the vein of keeping things as simple as possible, we came up with the\nfollowing set of guidelines:\n\n * The chat subsystem can expose add-on features to the user\n * These features will not be part of the core chat offering, but can be\n   plugged-in externally\n * These plugin-based entities — chat extensions — can have mainly two\n   capabilities\n * Display a button (widget) in a chat window to trigger the chat extension’s\n   functionality\n * Display chat extension messages that can support rich text, images,\n   call-to-actions\n\nChat extension messages are merely text messages with additional metadata. While\nplain text-based messages are rendered by the core chat rendering system, chat\nextension messages need to be rendered by the chat extension that created the\nmessage.\n\nChat Extension Framework — Key ActorsThe illustration above depicts the final\nframework components we came up with.\n\n * Chat Extension Providers are responsible for vending Chat Extensions based on\n   the active Chat Session (there might be cases where we want to enable a\n   certain feature only for certain types of chats e.g. those between our\n   drivers and customers).\n * Chat Extensions are the components responsible for vending trigger points (\n   Widget Views) and custom message views (Extension Message Views).\n\nWhile the core subsystem takes care of managing life cycles of the chat\nextensions, widgets, and message views, it is the responsibility of extension\nauthors to purely focus on the implementation details of their feature.\n\nWith the above design in place, we were ready to start collaborating and start\nimplementing features.\n\nLet’s take a look at some integrations we were able to build collaboratively.\n\nSample Integrations\nPayments\nThe first integration we did was Request and Pay flows. Utilising GoPay,\ncustomers can make payments and request for money from friends.\n\nHere’s the Request Flow in action, within a personal chat:\n\nRequest Money from an IndividualIn a group chat, Request Flow translates to a\nSplit Bill flow:\n\nRequest Money in a GroupHere’s the Pay flow in action:\n\nPay via GoPay, continue conversation in ChatIn the Pay Flow, we start with\nmaking a payment from the home-screen of the Gojek App. Once a payment is done,\nyou have an option to continue to chat with the person you made the payment to.\nThis flow is of course in addition to similar flows for Request where you can\ntrigger a payment within chat itself.\n\nThe payments team were able to create a UX flow that could be triggered either\nfrom the home screen or the chat window.\n\nRestaurant Sharing\nNext up, our GoFood team wanted to explore sharing restaurant information via\nchat. Since we already had support for extensions at this point in time, we\ncreated a generic Share Via Chat flow that supports sharing simple text messages\nor custom extension message content.\n\nIn the Pay Flow, we start with making a payment from the home-screen of the\nGojek App. Once a payment is done, you have an option to continue to chat with\nthe person you made the payment to. This flow is of course in addition to\nsimilar flows for Request where you can trigger a payment within chat itself.\n\nThe payments team were able to create a UX flow that could be triggered either\nfrom the home screen or the chat window.\n\nRestaurant Sharing\nNext up, our GoFood team wanted to explore sharing restaurant information via\nchat. Since we already had support for extensions at this point in time, we\ncreated a generic Share Via Chat flow that supports sharing simple text messages\nor custom extension message content.\n\n\nShare Restaurant Details via ChatWhat’s interesting is that once a Restaurant\nCard has been shared via chat, a recipient clicking on that card can proceed to\nmake a food order, directly from the chat window itself. This is made possible\nby the fact that Extension Message Views can be fully interactive (e.g. detect\nuser taps), and the chat window provides contextual navigation controls to them.\n\nImage Sharing\nLastly, let us take a look at the most recent feature we rolled out to\nproduction — image sharing in our customer-driver chats.\n\nImage Sharing via ChatDuring the implementation of this feature, we recognised\nthat image sharing would be better triggered from the chat window if there was a\ndirect shortcut button (e.g. a camera icon) within the bottom text input area of\nthe chat window.\n\nThis leads us to enhance our extension framework to allow Chat Extensions to\nprovide Chat Extension Shortcuts as well. Our updated framework looks like\nbelow:\n\nLessons Learned\nIt has been a great journey so far exploring various kinds of integrations in a\nsimple chat window. We have a lot more planned, but in the meanwhile, here are a\nfew key things we learned along the way\n\n * When you are developing a platform, evangelising what your platform provides\n   is key. This is equally relevant if you are a platform-product company, or a\n   platform team within a company. We conducted an internal chat extension\n   hackathon which helped broaden our outreach, and saw some pretty cool ideas\n   implemented including Live Location Sharing, Booking Sharing, Games, Sticker\n   Packs etc.\n * Document your public API! Teams are more willing to collaborate if you have\n   proper, up-to-date documentation in place. We created detailed technical\n   documents, integration guides, and even provided a sample chat extension (a\n   starter-pack, if you will) — these greatly helped teams adopting these new\n   features. Also, the feedback we got during the internal hackathon fed\n   directly back into improving our documentation.\n * Having a common design language helped our Android and iOS engineers to\n   collaborate more closely. It was easier for the team to work on implementing\n   the feature by focussing on the common characteristics during tech\n   discussion, design ratification sessions etc. and leaving the nuances of each\n   platform to respective teams during development. Having a common language\n   that engineers can speak (irrespective of their specialisations) improves\n   cross-communications and collaboration.\n * It is important to design solutions exercising self-imposed constraints.\n   These constraints should directly limit the engineering scope of the\n   solution. As engineers, we are all too comfortable going down the technical\n   analysis rabbit-hole in our pursuit of coming up with a well rounded, albeit\n   (possibly) over-engineered solution. This usually ends up in complicated\n   designs, which translate into complicated code. It is better to design\n   simpler systems and iteratively add smaller features, where each iteration\n   cycle should also incorporate refactoring every step of the way. Even though\n   we knew having something like Extension Shortcuts was nice to have from the\n   get go, we had to exercise restraint and only implemented the feature when it\n   was actually required.\n * We cannot stress this enough, but continuous refactoring (whenever required)\n   is one surefire way to reduce the build-up of tech debt in any codebase.\n   Improve a function here, rename a variable there, refactor a class into two —\n   every little bit helps. It is the responsibility of the entire team to be\n   engaged in this exercise.\n\nSo there you have it, a quick look at the way the core chat team developed a\nbase extension framework that is currently being used to build richer\nintegrations into chat.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWant more where that come from?

Thinking about burgers and crispy chicken fritters\nwith creamy sauces sitting on a warm, soft bun? At least, that’s what I am\nthinking about. May be you’re different. Vegan perhaps? Or craving noodles? Each\nof us turn into a different person when we are hungry, and this is the story\nabout how GoFood — Gojek’s food delivery service — helps you find the bite you\ncrave.\n\n> At the core of the food ordering experience, sits search.\nSearches are part of so many of our interactions on web and mobile, that we\ndon’t even notice it anymore. This is mostly because modern search engines have\nmatured to a point where they can deliver high quality results even if the\nentered query is a weak signal of the user’s intent. Even when weak, every query\nstill contains a piece of the user’s intent.\n\nIn the case of GoFood, that piece is a fragment of our user’s hunger-driven\nbrain.\n\nIn this post, we’ll discuss how we personalise the search results we surface on\nGoFood, based on the information we have about our users’ food preferences.\n\nHow Each of Us Differ\nLet’s look at two of our GoFood users who have started feeling the pangs of\nhunger, and come online to check restaurants near them.\n\nThey both open our app and click on the NEAR ME tile that lets users find the\nrestaurants near them. We show them the nearest restaurants first, and this is\nwhat they both see.\n\n\nThis list goes on and on and will let them see each restaurant which is farther\nand farther away. They can now peruse the menus of each restaurant and pick one\nthat serves what they feel like ordering. The problem is that they may spend\nsome time scrolling and then leave the app without being able to make up their\nminds around which restaurant to place an order from. We have thrown too many\nchoices at them and the cognitive effort of picking a restaurant and then a dish\nfrom the menu is too much work to make them suffer through.\n\nBut wait. Both Mila and Husain have transacted with us in the past, and we know\na fair bit about their preferences. 🤔\n\nTo make this experience better, we decided to build a system that would let both\nof them see restaurants that suit their own tastes and preferences\n\nApplying Machine Learning to the Problem\nRanking documents for relevance works by assigning a prediction score to each\ndocument retrieved, which is directly proportional to its relevance. In the case\nof NEAR ME restaurant ranking this can be something like:\n\n> Relevance score = 2 * (1/distance) + 1.2 * rating of restaurant\nHere in the relevance score calculation, we are taking weighted sum of different\nfactors like (1/distance) and rating of restaurant. The coefficients/weights of\nthese factors can be arrived at by experimenting with them and choosing weights\nthat seem to maximise the ordering conversions. But, in the case of restaurant\nranking in GoFood, we want to take into consideration many factors when deciding\nrelevance. Unfortunately, experimenting with combinations of all those factors\nis impossible.\n\nEnter Learning to rank. Here, the problem of deciding the rank of the\nrestaurants shown to the user is formulated as a supervised machine learning\nproblem.\n\nIf we look at past search, click, and ordering data, we will be able to assign\nrelevance judgements to each restaurant listing according to whether our users\nclicked or ordered from one of those restaurants. Restaurants that attracted\nhigher degrees of interest will be given higher degrees of relevance.\n\nIn the below example, a relevance judgement level of 0,1 and 2 is assigned to a\nrestaurant according to whether the user viewed, clicked, or ordered from the\nrestaurant in the search result. The relevance judgements are relative and only\nintent to be monotonically increasing with increasing relevance . They say that\nthe restaurant which the user created an order from is more relevant than a\nrestaurant the user merely checked out by clicking on it. They don’t mean that\nthe restaurant which received the order is twice as relevant .\n\nThe values of each of the factors that could have played a role in the user’s\ndecision of clicking or ordering is also shown against the restaurants.\n\nThree of the factors/features in the above example are marked as\n‘personalisation features’ because they would change according to the user’s\nprevious order history and location. These will be the features that will be\ndifferent between Mila and Husain because of the differences in the restaurants\nand cuisines they have ordered from before in the past.\n\n> These personalisation features are at the crux of creating personalised\nexperiences for each user\nOther customer agnostic features/factors like the rating, price range, and\npopularity of the restaurant are also listed here. GoFood has millions of such\nexamples where users with different tastes made different decisions when shown a\nset of search results. These examples can now be used to create a dataset from\nwhich the learning to rank ML algorithm can create a model to decide how\nrelevant a GoFood user would find a restaurant given that user’s location, order\nhistory and other restaurant statistics.\n\nHow We Ranked\nOne way to approach this was as a point-wise ranking problem, wherein we try to\npredict the relevance judgement of each restaurant. Based on this, later we will\npredict the relevance judgement level and sort restaurants in decreasing order\nof predicted relevance score. This approach reduces learning to rank problem to\na regression problem.\n\nAnother approach was to solve it is a pairwise ranking problem, wherein the ML\nmodel is trying to learn how to get the order of a pair of restaurants correct\ni.e if Restaurant A is more preferable to Restaurant B , the order (Restaurant\nA, Restaurant B) is correct and the order (Restaurant B, Restaurant A) is wrong.\n\nFor an ML model to be learned, we need an objective function that captures this\npairwise ordering formulation . This is called a loss function or error function\nin ML and is the measure through which an ML model can assess how right or wrong\nits decision was. In pairwise ranking , this should be a function that becomes\nhigher whenever the model misjudges a preference order and becomes lower when it\nis right about the preference order.\n\nThe loss/error function C is explained below:\n\nWhen this function is minimised, the model is trying to predict a score for each\nrestaurant such that the ranking of the order of the restaurants are close the\nrelevance judgements the users made.\n\nThe pairwise formulation is a better approach here in comparison to the\npoint-wise approach as it is looking to get the order of restaurants right and\nis not trying to estimate the relevance score themselves whose values were\nassigned only as markers to show how some restaurants were more preferred\nrelative to others.\n\nWe used an implementation of the LambdaMART algorithm that learns to predict\nrelevance scores so as to minimise this pairwise loss. You can think of this as\na pursuit to find the decision tree that takes in all the parameters of the\nrestaurant and gives out a score to the restaurant .

Thinking about burgers and crispy chicken fritters with creamy sauces sitting on a warm, soft bun? At least, that’s what I am thinking about. May be you’re different. Vegan perhaps? Or craving noodles? Each of us turn into a different person when we are hungry, and this is the story about how GoFood — Gojek’s food delivery service — helps you find the bite you crave.</p><blockquote><em><em>At the core of the food ordering experience, sits search.</em></em></blockquote><p>Searches are part of so many of our interactions on web and mobile, that we don’t even notice it anymore. This is mostly because modern search engines have matured to a point where they can deliver high quality results even if the entered query is a weak signal of the user’s intent. Even when weak, every query still contains a piece of the user’s intent.</p><p><em><em>In the case of GoFood, that piece is a fragment of our user’s hunger-driven brain.</em></em></p><p>In this post, we’ll discuss how we personalise the search results we surface on GoFood, based on the information we have about our users’ food preferences.</p><h1 id=\"how-each-of-us-differ\">How Each of Us Differ</h1><p>Let’s look at two of our GoFood users who have started feeling the pangs of hunger, and come online to check restaurants near them.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/3192/1*AP6fdakISbNOdEZyCUxa5g.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>They both open our app and click on the <code>NEAR ME</code> tile that lets users find the restaurants near them. We show them the nearest restaurants first, and this is what they both see.<br></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/2322/1*tBxtTKY9cfA7rcl5LXq3Ag.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>This list goes on and on and will let them see each restaurant which is farther and farther away. They can now peruse the menus of each restaurant and pick one that serves what they feel like ordering. The problem is that they may spend some time scrolling and then leave the app without being able to make up their minds around which restaurant to place an order from. We have thrown too many choices at them and the cognitive effort of picking a restaurant and then a dish from the menu is too much work to make them suffer through.</p><p><strong><strong><em><em>But wait. Both Mila and Husain have transacted with us in the past, and we know a fair bit about their preferences.</em></em> 🤔</strong></strong></p><p>To make this experience better, we decided to build a system that would let both of them see restaurants that suit their own tastes and preferences</p><h1 id=\"applying-machine-learning-to-the-problem\">Applying Machine Learning to the Problem</h1><p>Ranking documents for relevance works by assigning a prediction score to each document retrieved, which is directly proportional to its relevance. In the case of <code>NEAR ME</code> restaurant ranking this can be something like:</p><blockquote><em><em><em>Relevance score = 2 * (1/distance) + 1.2 * rating of restaurant</em></em></em></blockquote><p>Here in the relevance score calculation, we are taking weighted sum of different factors like <em><em>(1/distance) </em></em>and <em><em>rating of restaurant</em></em>. The coefficients/weights of these factors can be arrived at by experimenting with them and choosing weights that seem to maximise the ordering conversions. But, in the case of restaurant ranking in GoFood, we want to take into consideration many factors when deciding relevance. Unfortunately, experimenting with combinations of all those factors is impossible.</p><p>Enter L<em><em>earning to rank</em></em>. Here, the problem of deciding the rank of the restaurants shown to the user is formulated as a supervised machine learning problem.</p><p>If we look at past search, click, and ordering data, we will be able to assign relevance judgements to each restaurant listing according to whether our users clicked or ordered from one of those restaurants. Restaurants that attracted higher degrees of interest will be given higher degrees of relevance.</p><p>In the below example, a relevance judgement level of 0,1 and 2 is assigned to a restaurant according to whether the user viewed, clicked, or ordered from the restaurant in the search result. The relevance judgements are relative and only intent to be monotonically increasing with increasing relevance . They say that the restaurant which the user created an order from is more relevant than a restaurant the user merely checked out by clicking on it. <strong><strong>They don’t mean that the restaurant which received the order is twice as relevant .</strong></strong></p><p>The values of each of the factors that could have played a role in the user’s decision of clicking or ordering is also shown against the restaurants.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/2376/1*X0Oe0KA7ZTU2wYa2SXS_CA.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>Three of the factors/features in the above example are marked as ‘personalisation features’ because they would change according to the user’s previous order history and location. These will be the features that will be different between Mila and Husain because of the differences in the restaurants and cuisines they have ordered from before in the past.</p><blockquote>These personalisation features are at the crux of creating personalised experiences for each user</blockquote><p>Other customer agnostic features/factors like the rating, price range, and popularity of the restaurant are also listed here. GoFood has millions of such examples where users with different tastes made different decisions when shown a set of search results. These examples can now be used to create a dataset from which the learning to rank ML algorithm can create a model to decide how relevant a GoFood user would find a restaurant given that user’s location, order history and other restaurant statistics.</p><h1 id=\"how-we-ranked\">How We Ranked</h1><p>One way to approach this was as a point-wise ranking problem, wherein we try to predict the relevance judgement of each restaurant. Based on this, later we will predict the relevance judgement level and sort restaurants in decreasing order of predicted relevance score. This approach reduces learning to rank problem to a regression problem.</p><p>Another approach was to solve it is a pairwise ranking problem, wherein the ML model is trying to learn how to get the order of a pair of restaurants correct i.e if Restaurant A is more preferable to Restaurant B , the order (Restaurant A, Restaurant B) is correct and the order (Restaurant B, Restaurant A) is wrong.</p><p>For an ML model to be learned, we need an objective function that captures this pairwise ordering formulation . This is called a loss function or error function in ML and is the measure through which an ML model can assess how right or wrong its decision was. In pairwise ranking , this should be a function that becomes higher whenever the model misjudges a preference order and becomes lower when it is right about the preference order.</p><p>The loss/error function <strong><strong><em><em>C</em></em></strong></strong> is explained below:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/3316/1*2sWi_7l1iI_-dRppVoaGRA.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>When this function is minimised, the model is trying to predict a score for each restaurant such that the ranking of the order of the restaurants are close the relevance judgements the users made.</p><p>The pairwise formulation is a better approach here in comparison to the point-wise approach as it is looking to get the order of restaurants right and is not trying to estimate the relevance score themselves whose values were assigned only as markers to show how some restaurants were more preferred relative to others.</p><p>We used an implementation of the LambdaMART algorithm that learns to predict relevance scores so as to minimise this pairwise loss. You can think of this as a pursuit to find the decision tree that takes in all the parameters of the restaurant and gives out a score to the restaurant . This score should be assigned in such a way as to make the pair orders right.</p><p>Once this model is trained, it can be used during search, as explained in <a href=\"https://blog.gojekengineering.com/how-the-gojek-butler-serves-a-gourmet-meal-to-our-users-4a161d83052a?source=friends_link&amp;sk=42397976fe914a418ac40f19545f90b7\">this post</a>.</p><p>Now let’s go back to our beloved customers — Mila and Husain. The next time Mila or Husain looks for restaurants near them, the search results they see will be according to their preferences. This is because the model would look at the number of times they have ordered from each of the restaurants near them before.

However, in order to sustain this growth, we need to keep adding\nquality engineering talent to our ranks. To help with this, we rely on our\nin-house recruiters, who’ve been doing a phenomenal job. 👌\n\n> But the question remains — how do we continue to keep this up at scale?\nWe’ve been trying to find a solution to this question, and as is usually the\ncase when it comes to Gojek, the answer lies in innovation. Just like every\nother domain we operate in, we needed to innovate in tech recruitment as well.\n\nWhen our team joined Gojek\n[https://blog.gojekengineering.com/gojek-acquires-aircto-expands-operations-in-india-d685c0b4db1c]\n, we had one clear objective — apply the learnings from our previous startup to\nhelp Gojek find innovative ways to hire top engineering talent.\n\nThis is the story of how we’re doing it.\n\nEarly Days and Finding Our North star\nIn the first two weeks after we joined, we consulted with engineering heads,\ntech recruiters, and the India Inbound Marketing team. Over the course of\ncomparing notes from many meetings, we hoped to find patterns in how Gojek\nhired, and how we could automate the discovery of more people with similar\ntraits. Undertaking this exercise was at once a rewarding and challenging\nexperience for our team.\n\nWe got interesting insights, but also ran into conflicting data. Gojek had also\nrecently switched to a new Application Tracking Service (ATS), which brought its\nown set of unknowns. Navigating these unknowns and changing processes in an\norganisation with many fast-moving parts was our first order of business. In\nbetween all this, finding the formula for the kind of candidates we were looking\nfor was like looking for a needle in a haystack. Most of the problems that we\nidentified at these meetings turned out to be operational issues — an insight\nprovided by our India MD, Sidu Ponnappa.\n\nMeanwhile, we needed a name for our team which people could use to identify us.\nWe named ourselves Magneto. To achieve our task of finding top developers, we\nwould need the superhuman power of attraction.\n\nTesting Our Powers\nGojek has a rigorous interview process, and we are picky about who we hire, to\nthe point where even people outside of Gojek know how tough it is to get in.\n\n> Hoardings, Metro Wraps, Radio Ads by @gojektech\n[https://twitter.com/gojektech?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw] to hire in Gurgaon are hard\nto miss - \nand have heard that their selection process is one of the rigorous ones so don’t\nassume they are desperate to hire anyone who applies 😄\n\n— deepakabbot (@deepakabbot) September 25, 2019\n[https://twitter.com/deepakabbot/status/1176710364030881797?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw]\nWe did get one key takeaway though. All our tests and questions are designed to\nidentify a few common traits:\n\n> In a nutshell, we’re biased towards developers who are hands-on and can code;\nirrespective of their prior experience and pedigree.\nAnother interesting fact: according to our internal data, a whopping 50% of\ncandidates who go through our interview process fail the first test assignment\nround. 😮\n\nI was surprised to see candidates from top product companies unable to get\nthrough this round.\n\nAfter looking at this daunting drop-off data, and acknowledging that we were\nvery new to Gojek’s hiring process, we decided to take baby steps. The goal: \nhire 1 engineer for GoFood. We also set up some key results to track back\ntowards our objective.\n\nCrafting A Solution\nWe knew we needed to find top developers who could make it through our\nrecruitment process, and then reach out to them to check if they would be\ninterested in joining us.\n\n> So we made this theme a problem statement, and divided it into two parts:\n> 1. Discover\n> 2. Nurture\nAs a first step, we pulled out profiles of engineers we hired from Lever (our\nApplication Tracking Service) and found many of them to be active on\ncode-related online digital platforms that reflect their passion for\nprogramming.\n\n> We finally knew where to start looking for our needle.\nOur first stop was the most obvious one — Github. Then we went to StackOverflow\nand finally, Twitter. StackOverflow itself hosts over 10 million developers.\n\nStackOverflow StatsThere’s a lot of publicly available information on these\nplatforms, so we wrote a bunch of scripts to pull info about developers from\nGithub and StackOverflow. Then we tried to map their skills, contributions,\npopularity, and activities.\n\nWe wrote custom algorithms for Github and StackOverflow to classify developers\nas qualified and unqualified, based on the criteria we were looking for. We\nlooked at various signals to check their passion for programming, and they\npassed a certain pre-defined threshold, we would mark them as qualified.\n\nOnce a candidate is qualified, we needed to categorise them based on skills,\nexperience, location, and other parameters. This step also involved some manual\nwork to clean up the data.\n\nIn order to meet our first objective, we picked around 800 candidates and\nreached out to them through personalised email campaigns. Since our team was\nquite comfortable using Python, we used Python on top of PostgreSQL to write the\nNurture system to run these email campaigns (despite Python not being part of\nGojek’s core tech stack).\n\nThe Discover <> Nurture FlowSmelling success\nAfter rigorous follow-ups, we ended up getting a decent number of interested\ncandidates, whom we then contacted for exploratory conversations.\n\nThis was quite the enlightening experience — and we realised Gojek is perceived\nas a highly tech-oriented company among developers.\n\n> Over 62% of the candidates who submitted the test assignment cleared it, and by\nthe time we finished the first cohort, we ended up hiring 3 devs.\nWe exceeded our target by 300%. 🙌\n\nThe smile of successAutomation FTW\nAs we succeeded in demonstrating the viability of our MVP, we had to look at the\nproblem statement again and translate it into a scalable system. Tackling scale\nhas always been a part of Gojek’s journey to #SuperApp status, so we decided to\nbe prepared.\n\nWhile scaling the Candidate Discovery Process, we ran into two issues:\n\n 1. Since the discovery level was managed on spreadsheets, it required a massive\n    manual effort to keep the data unique between each service.\n 2. Getting candidate info from different sources required a lot of data-sharing\n    on multiple platforms. The result — repetitive processes and data\n    duplication. 🤦‍♂️\n\nConsidering these challenges, we divided the process into 3 different layers:\n\n 1. Service layer: Contains individual micro-service which has single behaviour\n    — fetch details from a specific source and score, classify, and merge them\n    based on the data available on different mediums about a candidate.\n 2. Messaging layer: At any point in time, any individual service can connect to\n    other services to fetch more information about the candidate. For instance,\n    while parsing StackOverflow users, we get the user’s website and Github\n    URLs. So, the StackOverflow service will publish candidate’s Github social\n    id and website URL to the Github and WebScrapper services respectively. This\n    information about the candidate is then written to the database.\n 3. Data layer: It is a centralised MongoDB that stores all the data (even if\n    it’s incomplete) from different sources, which can further be pushed to\n    Nurture once it is verified.\n\nWe also dockerized all these micro-services, integrated monitoring (Prometheus),\nSlack alerts & logging (Barito [https://github.com/BaritoLog/wiki] — thanks to\nour Barito team for offering a powerful logging system).\n\nWith this automated system, we processed over 38,000 tech candidates’ profiles\nin a very short time, and found around 10,000 qualified candidates who passed\nour custom criteria.\n\nThis was our Aha! Moment.\n\nWith automation, we managed to make 13 offers to developers in a very short span\nof time, 6 of whom have already joined us.\n\nLaunching Fount\nSo far we had been the customers of our own product. But this needed to be\nbigger. We needed to get our product out to our internal recruiters to use.\n\n> However, there was one problem.\nThe Nurture system was written in Python, and we primarily use Ruby, Go, Java,\nand Clojure at Gojek. When you rely on tech stack not extensively used by the\nlarger org, you end up building your own tooling systems to test and deploy on\nthe existing infrastructure (which is already stable and working for other\nteams).\n\nTherefore, we decided to re-write the Nurture system in Clojure. I had prior\nexperience of writing programs in Common Lisp & Clojure. To my surprise, the\nteam was also excited to try out functional programming (I will soon write a\nseparate article on our experience in building API in Clojure. Pinky promise!).\n\nThere were a few hiccups in getting things moving around the infra and security\nsystems, but that was a given considering we were fairly new to the existing\ninfrastructure. We built the Nurture API in Clojure and a frontend in Reactjs.\nIn 30 days, we were up and running with our product.\n\n> We call it Fount.\nFount lists all the qualified discovered candidates; leads our recruiters can\nthen follow up on to check their interest and move into our hiring funnel.\nCurrently, a few beta users (our internal tech recruiters) are trying out the\nsystem. 🖖\n\nWe have already redesigned Fount and this is how it looks now. Thanks to Asphalt\n[https://asphalt.gojek.io/]— our very own design system at Gojek.\n\nAI Powered Candidate Discovery PlatformThe Way Forward\nThis was just the first step in our journey of streamlining recruitment at\nGojek. We’re planning to improve our sourcing algorithms, find new sources,\nimprove the candidate verification process, and build new features on Fount.\n\nWe’re also going to attack different tech recruiting problems and bring\nautomation wherever possible in order to hire top developers (and offer up a\ngreat candidate experience).\n\nThat’s all from us for now.

To help with this, we rely on our in-house recruiters, who’ve been doing a phenomenal job. 👌</p><blockquote><strong>But the question remains — how do we continue to keep this up at scale?</strong></blockquote><p>We’ve been trying to find a solution to this question, and as is usually the case when it comes to Gojek, the answer lies in innovation. Just like every other domain we operate in, we needed to innovate in tech recruitment as well.</p><p>When our team <a href=\"https://blog.gojekengineering.com/gojek-acquires-aircto-expands-operations-in-india-d685c0b4db1c\" rel=\"noopener\">joined Gojek</a>, we had one clear objective — apply the learnings from our previous startup to help Gojek find innovative ways to hire top engineering talent.</p><p>This is the story of how we’re doing it.</p><h3 id=\"early-days-and-finding-our-north-star\">Early Days and Finding Our North star</h3><p>In the first two weeks after we joined, we consulted with engineering heads, tech recruiters, and the India Inbound Marketing team. Over the course of comparing notes from many meetings, we hoped to find patterns in how Gojek hired, and how we could automate the discovery of more people with similar traits. Undertaking this exercise was at once a rewarding and challenging experience for our team.</p><p>We got interesting insights, but also ran into conflicting data. Gojek had also recently switched to a new Application Tracking Service (ATS), which brought its own set of unknowns. Navigating these unknowns and changing processes in an organisation with many fast-moving parts was our first order of business. In between all this, finding the formula for the kind of candidates we were looking for was like looking for a needle in a haystack. Most of the problems that we identified at these meetings turned out to be operational issues — an insight provided by our India MD, Sidu Ponnappa.</p><p>Meanwhile, we needed a name for our team which people could use to identify us. We named ourselves <strong><strong>Magneto</strong></strong>. To achieve our task of finding top developers, we would need the superhuman power of attraction.</p><h3 id=\"testing-our-powers\">Testing Our Powers</h3><p>Gojek has a rigorous interview process, and we are picky about who we hire, to the point where even people outside of Gojek know how tough it is to get in.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Hoardings, Metro Wraps, Radio Ads by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gojektech?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@gojektech</a> to hire in Gurgaon are hard to miss - <br>and have heard that their selection process is one of the rigorous ones so don’t assume they are desperate to hire anyone who applies 😄</p>&mdash; deepakabbot (@deepakabbot) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/deepakabbot/status/1176710364030881797?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 25, 2019</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n</figure><p>We did get one key takeaway though. All our tests and questions are designed to identify a few common traits:</p><blockquote><em><em>In a nutshell, we’re biased towards developers who are hands-on and can code; irrespective of their prior experience and pedigree.</em></em></blockquote><p>Another interesting fact: according to our internal data, a whopping 50% of candidates who go through our interview process <strong><strong><em><em>fail the first test assignment round</em></em></strong></strong>. 😮</p><p>I was surprised to see candidates from top product companies unable to get through this round.</p><p>After looking at this daunting drop-off data, and acknowledging that we were very new to Gojek’s hiring process, we decided to take baby steps. The goal: <strong><strong>hire 1 engineer for GoFood. </strong></strong>We also set up some key results to track back towards our objective.</p><h3 id=\"crafting-a-solution\">Crafting A Solution</h3><p>We knew we needed to find top developers who could make it through our recruitment process, and then reach out to them to check if they would be interested in joining us.</p><blockquote><em>So we made this theme a problem statement, and divided it into two parts:</em></blockquote><blockquote><em><em><em>1. Discover</em></em></em></blockquote><blockquote><em><em><em>2. Nurture</em></em></em></blockquote><p>As a first step, we pulled out profiles of engineers we hired from Lever (our Application Tracking Service) and found many of them to be active on code-related online digital platforms that reflect their passion for programming.</p><blockquote>We finally knew where to start looking for our needle.</blockquote><p>Our first stop was the most obvious one — Github. Then we went to StackOverflow and finally, Twitter. StackOverflow itself hosts over 10 million developers.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://gojek-ghost.zysk.in/content/images/2020/05/1_KbHxqGC8qosP6HE99pLzKQ.png\" class=\"kg-image\"><figcaption><em>StackOverflow Stats</em></figcaption></figure><p>There’s a lot of publicly available information on these platforms, so we wrote a bunch of scripts to pull info about developers from Github and StackOverflow. Then we tried to map their skills, contributions, popularity, and activities.</p><p>We wrote custom algorithms for Github and StackOverflow to classify developers as qualified and unqualified, based on the criteria we were looking for. We looked at various signals to check their passion for programming, and they passed a certain pre-defined threshold, we would mark them as qualified.</p><p>Once a candidate is qualified, we needed to categorise them based on skills, experience, location, and other parameters. This step also involved some manual work to clean up the data.</p><p>In order to meet our first objective, we picked around 800 candidates and reached out to them through personalised email campaigns. Since our team was quite comfortable using Python, we used Python on top of PostgreSQL to write the Nurture system to run these email campaigns (despite Python not being part of Gojek’s core tech stack).</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://gojek-ghost.zysk.in/content/images/2020/05/1_GHx2ht682c0V23r-Bk5pvA.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\"><figcaption>The Discover &lt;&gt; Nurture Flow</figcaption></figure><h3 id=\"smelling-success\">Smelling success</h3><p>After rigorous follow-ups, we ended up getting a decent number of interested candidates, whom we then contacted for exploratory conversations.</p><p>This was quite the enlightening experience — and we realised Gojek is perceived as a highly tech-oriented company among developers.</p><blockquote>Over 62% of the candidates who submitted the test assignment cleared it, and by the time we finished the first cohort, we ended up hiring 3 devs.</blockquote><p>We exceeded our target by 300%. 🙌</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://gojek-ghost.zysk.in/content/images/2020/05/1_rjDDcWnOZeFFDRZdM-FCdQ.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\"><figcaption>The smile of success</figcaption></figure><h3 id=\"automation-ftw\">Automation FTW</h3><p>As we succeeded in demonstrating the viability of our MVP, we had to look at the problem statement again and translate it into a scalable system. Tackling scale has always been a part of Gojek’s journey to #SuperApp status, so we decided to be prepared.</p><p>While scaling the Candidate Discovery Process, we ran into two issues:</p><ol><li>Since the discovery level was managed on spreadsheets, it required a massive manual effort to keep the data unique between each service.</li><li>Getting candidate info from different sources required a lot of data-sharing on multiple platforms. The result — repetitive processes and data duplication. 🤦‍♂️</li></ol><p>Considering these challenges, we divided the process into 3 different layers:</p><ol><li><strong><strong>Service layer:</strong></strong> Contains individual micro-service which has single behaviour — fetch details from a specific source and score, classify, and merge them based on the data available on different mediums about a candidate.</li><li><strong><strong>Messaging layer:</strong></strong> At any point in time, any individual service can connect to other services to fetch more information about the candidate. For instance, while parsing StackOverflow users, we get the user’s website and Github URLs. So, the StackOverflow service will publish candidate’s Github social id and website URL to the Github and WebScrapper services respectively. This information about the candidate is then written to the database.</li><li><strong><strong>Data layer:</strong></strong> It is a centralised MongoDB that stores all the data (even if it’s incomplete) from different sources, which can further be pushed to Nurture once it is verified.</li></ol><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"https://gojek-ghost.zysk.in/content/images/2020/05/1_Aw3fPTBAj5YMdP5N2zQy9A.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>We also dockerized all these micro-services, integrated monitoring (Prometheus), Slack alerts &amp; logging (<a href=\"https://github.com/BaritoLog/wiki\" rel=\"noopener\">Barito</a> — thanks to our Barito team for offering a powerful logging system).</p><p>With this automated system, we processed over 38,000 tech candidates’ profiles in a very short time, and found around 10,000 qualified candidates who passed our custom criteria.</p><p><strong><strong><em><em>This was our Aha! Moment.</em></em></strong></strong></p><p>With automation, we managed to make 13 offers to developers in a very short span of time, 6 of whom have already joined us.</p><h3 id=\"launching-fount\">Launching Fount</h3><p>So far we had been the customers of our own product. But this needed to be bigger. We needed to get our product out to our internal recruiters to use.</p><blockquote>However, there was one problem.</blockquote><p>The Nurture system was written in Python, and we primarily use Ruby, Go, Java, and Clojure at Gojek. When you rely on tech stack not extensively used by the larger org, you end up building your own tooling systems to test and deploy on the existing infrastructure (which is already stable and working for other teams).</p><p>Therefore, we decided to re-write the Nurture system in Clojure. I had prior experience of writing programs in Common Lisp &amp; Clojure. To my surprise, the team was also excited to try out functional programming (I will soon write a separate article on our experience in building API in Clojure. Pinky promise!).</p><p>There were a few hiccups in getting things moving around the infra and security systems, but that was a given considering we were fairly new to the existing infrastructure. We built the Nurture API in Clojure and a frontend in Reactjs. In 30 days, we were up and running with our product.</p><blockquote>We call it Fount.</blockquote><p>Fount lists all the qualified discovered candidates; leads our recruiters can then follow up on to check their interest and move into our hiring funnel. Currently, a few beta users (our internal tech recruiters) are trying out the system. 🖖</p><p>We have already redesigned Fount and this is how it looks now. Thanks to <a href=\"https://asphalt.gojek.io/\" rel=\"noopener\">Asphalt </a>— our very own design system at Gojek.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://gojek-ghost.zysk.in/content/images/2020/05/1_ryHN4fsHSsi0gmiDk64F7w.png\" class=\"kg-image\"><figcaption>AI Powered Candidate Discovery Platform</figcaption></figure><h3 id=\"the-way-forward\">The Way Forward</h3><p>This was just the first step in our journey of streamlining recruitment at Gojek. We’re planning to improve our sourcing algorithms, find new sources, improve the candidate verification process, and build new features on Fount.</p><p>We’re also going to attack different tech recruiting problems and bring automation wherever possible in order to hire top developers (and offer up a great candidate experience).</p><p>That’s all from us for now.

GoFood — Gojek’s food\ndelivery product — lists 400,000+ merchants. You search for the outlet you want\nto order from, select the item and quantity, check out, and pay either via cash\nor Gojek’s digital wallet GoPay. Then, you sit back and watch the little Gojek\ndriver partner on the screen zoom their way to the restaurant, and bring you\nsome fried banana goodness. 😍\n\nSimple. Fast. Reliable.\n\n> Rewind a few years, and things didn’t look so good.\nFirst, some context\nWhen GoFood launched in 2015, expansion and adoption happened rapidly. The\norders started piling in, and we were struggling to keep up with demand.\nInitially, we’d simply list food merchants on our marketplace, send demand their\nway, and fulfil it through our fleet of driver partners.\n\nWe were building for our consumers and driver partners, but merchants were\nalways a key component of our ecosystem. If Gojek is an iceberg, the\nconsumer-facing Super App is the part above water. In this story, we’ll dive\nbeneath the surface to explore another key component — GoBiz, our merchant\nSuperApp.\n\n> But before GoBiz, there was GoResto.\nThe Merchant Problem\nIf we had ordered ourselves that pisang goreng in the early days of GoFood,\nthings would have worked very differently.\n\nYou see, merchants were onboarded by the GoFood team by uploading their menus to\nour systems. We’d look through these menus to find our fried banana of choice,\nand make an order, which would be relayed directly to a driver partner. This\npartner would then go to the restaurant and place the order (which is when the\nmerchant partner gets involved in the process).\n\nSo, while our bananas are fried, the driver partner would wait around, and when\nthe order is ready, pay in cash. The problem with this approach was that there\nwas no record of the transaction besides a booking on GoFood and a receipt\nhanded to the driver partner.\n\nThis was an inefficient system, for driver partners, and our customers.\n\n> Oh, and those merchants? Things weren’t rosy for them either.\nLet’s assume our pisang goreng place is a GoFood partner (meaning Gojek collects\ncommissions for the increased demand we send their way), and also part of a\nlarger chain. When we place the order, GoFood will assign it to one outlet of\nthe chain. However, our driver partner may decide to visit another outlet and\npick up the order from there.\n\nAt the end of the month, our restaurant partners would be invoiced for\ncommission that was due to us, based on sales as reported by the GoFood app.\nThis meant we were charging some merchants commission for sales their outlet may\nhave never made.\n\nWe spent a lot of time and resources addressing merchant complaints. 🤦‍♂️\n\n> Then there was the matter of control.\nIf a merchant partner was not open for business on a particular day, wanted to\nupdate their menu, or indicate items as out of stock, they had to call Gojek\nCustomer Care. During this time, orders might still be coming in.\n\nLet’s just say we weren’t doing ourselves any favours. 🤷🏻‍♂️\n\nThere was a lot that needed fixing here, and it could only be done by\nintegrating merchants more deeply into our ecosystem. So that’s what we did.\n\nThe birth of GoResto\nTowards the end of 2016, a concept was developed for an app that would cater to\nGoFood merchant partners, and by early 2017 GoResto — which is what we called it\nat the time — was ready. You can read more about the product research process\nthat went into making GoResto here\n[https://blog.gojekengineering.com/whats-cooking-diving-into-kitchens-for-go-biz-e01051bfdc98]\n).\n\nWith GoResto, we addressed some of the problems outlined earlier.\n\n1. Electronic payments\nAll of Gojek’s driver partners had GoPay e-wallets associated with their\naccounts. With GoResto, we did the same for GoFood merchants. Transactions\nbetween driver and merchant partners would now be wallet-to-wallet, not cash.\nGojek would deduct any applicable commission immediately from the merchant\nwallet. This made the reconciliation process with merchants simpler.\n\n2. PIN exchange for restaurant verification\nTo eliminate fraud, driver partners would also need to share a PIN with the\nmerchant while picking up the order. This electronic handshake helped us verify\nthey were indeed picking up the right order from the right outlet.\n\nIt was a decent solution. If all went according to plan, we could breathe easy.\n\n> As you might have guessed, all did not go according to plan. 🙇‍♂️\nIn the first iteration, the wallet creation process required collaboration with\nthe GoPay team, which was itself facing bandwidth constraints due to rapid\ngrowth (which we’ll talk about a little later).\n\nAlso, the merchant onboarding to GoResto at this point was still a manual\nprocess. In our first month, we onboarded only 26 merchants. 😣\n\nWe needed a more scalable solution.\n\nHere’s a quick note on Gojek company culture. When the chips are down, it’s\nimportant for organisations to have core values to guide decision-making. One of\nour values happens to be:\n\nThis line is an affirmation to all stakeholders to take the best decision for a\nparticular situation based on available information. Such decisions are then\nrespected by everyone else.\n\nWe made two drastic decisions:\n\n 1. Merchant onboarding was completely frozen until we could build a platform to\n    automate the process.\n 2. Engineers from the Merchants team were embedded within GoPay, building\n    required capacities on GoPay systems while core GoPay engineers continued\n    work on scaling the platform.\n\n> In three months, as summer rolled around, GoResto was back.\nWe weren’t out of the woods yet though. All this was happening before Gojek had\ndeprecated its legacy codebase, Stan Marsh\n[https://blog.gojekengineering.com/thank-you-stan-marsh-29db553544bf], in favour\nof microservices, so system stability was not exactly excellent. As a result, we\nstill faced sync issues between GoFood and GoResto order management systems.\nThis, in turn, began to reflect on us publicly.\n\nOur app store rating at this point slid down to 3.2.\n\nMake It Work, Then Make It Better\nWe clearly had a long way to go to make GoResto the app our merchants deserved.\nThings were bad, but as they say — sometimes the only way out is through.\n\nChallenge accepted. 💪\n\nFirst things first, we went about fixing the sync issues by building a second\nsystem to replace our unreliable version. Not only was this accomplished, but\nall onboarded merchants were migrated to the new system, with zero downtime. \nRead more about how this was done in this post\n[https://blog.gojekengineering.com/zero-downtime-traffic-migration-at-go-food-17ba413eb8c2]\n.\n\n> One small win.\nNow for the real problems, giving merchants the control they needed over how\nthey were represented on GoFood. The first self-serve feature we introduced to\nGoResto was allowing merchants to update their restaurant status in real time.\n\n> Another small win.\nWe had unlocked a critical component in product design — empathy for the people\nyou’re building for. The question now was — what can we do that will make life\neasier for our merchants?\n\nItem availability? Understood.\nMenu updation? Got it.\nPricing adjustments? Why not.\nAdd categories? Move items between categories? Update images?\n\n> Done, done… and done. ✅\nOur systems were stable, early teething troubles were addressed, we were finally\nsolving the problems that needed solving.\n\nBuild It Right, And They Will Come\nAs GoResto grew in functionality, we began\n\n slowly earning back the goodwill of our merchant community. Soon, our app store\nrating began to reflect that.\n\nApp store ratings reflecting how customer goodwill can be earned back ✌️We\ndidn’t need to push GoResto to merchants anymore, it was adopted due to the ease\nof doing business it offered.\n\n> It was long overdue, but we had accomplished what we had set out to do. There\nwas finally a moment to sit back and enjoy the sunrise.\nOr so we thought.\n\nThe rest was short-lived. Southeast Asia was abuzz with activity. According to\nthis report\n[https://www.blog.google/documents/47/SEA_Internet_Economy_Report_2019.pdf], the\nvalue of the Internet economy in the region tripled in the years since 2015. The\nGross Merchandise Value (GMV) projection for 2025 is estimated to be $300\nbillion.\n\n> To put that in perspective — in 2016, that projection was $100 billion.\nEven as GoResto was being built, there was another behemoth stirring under the\nrich waters of Indonesia’s digital payments landscape. GoPay, which had been\nrapidly growing in this favourable environment since its arrival in 2016, was\nnow being used by roughly three-quarters of digital payments users in Indonesia.\n\nBut we wanted more.\n\nIn 2018, GoPay introduced offline acceptance, bringing a whole new category of\nmerchant partners into our ecosystem.\n\n> Our existing solution wasn’t good enough anymore. It was time to evolve.\nKeep watching this space for the continued story charting GoResto’s evolution\ninto our full-fledged merchants platform — GoBiz.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWant our updates beamed straight to your inbox?

If all went according to plan, we could breathe easy.</p><blockquote>As you might have guessed, all did not go according to plan. 🙇‍♂️</blockquote><p>In the first iteration, the wallet creation process required collaboration with the GoPay team, which was itself facing bandwidth constraints due to rapid growth (which we’ll talk about a little later).</p><p>Also, the merchant onboarding to GoResto at this point was still a manual process. In our first month, we onboarded only 26 merchants. 😣</p><p>We needed a more scalable solution.</p><p>Here’s a quick note on Gojek company culture. When the chips are down, it’s important for organisations to have core values to guide decision-making.

Such decisions are then respected by everyone else.</p><p>We made two drastic decisions:</p><ol><li>Merchant onboarding was completely frozen until we could build a platform to automate the process.</li><li>Engineers from the Merchants team were embedded within GoPay, building required capacities on GoPay systems while core GoPay engineers continued work on scaling the platform.</li></ol><blockquote>In three months, as summer rolled around, GoResto was back.</blockquote><p>We weren’t out of the woods yet though. All this was happening before Gojek had deprecated its legacy codebase, <a href=\"https://blog.gojekengineering.com/thank-you-stan-marsh-29db553544bf\" rel=\"noopener\">Stan Marsh</a>, in favour of microservices, so system stability was not exactly excellent. As a result, we still faced sync issues between GoFood and GoResto order management systems. This, in turn, began to reflect on us publicly.</p><p><strong><strong>Our app store rating at this point slid down to 3.2.</strong></strong></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/794/1*tK41Ht4hzRXSuKNR5w2qxA.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><h1 id=\"make-it-work-then-make-it-better\">Make It Work, Then Make It Better</h1><p>We clearly had a long way to go to make GoResto the app our merchants deserved. Things were bad, but as they say — sometimes the only way out is through.</p><p><strong><strong>Challenge accepted. 💪</strong></strong></p><p>First things first, we went about fixing the sync issues by building a second system to replace our unreliable version. Not only was this accomplished, but all onboarded merchants were migrated to the new system, with <em><em>zero downtime. </em></em>Read more about how this was done <a href=\"https://blog.gojekengineering.com/zero-downtime-traffic-migration-at-go-food-17ba413eb8c2\" rel=\"noopener\">in this post</a>.</p><blockquote><em><em>One small win.</em></em></blockquote><p>Now for the real problems, giving merchants the control they needed over how they were represented on GoFood. The first self-serve feature we introduced to GoResto was allowing merchants to update their restaurant status in real time.</p><blockquote><em><em>Another small win.</em></em></blockquote><p>We had unlocked a critical component in product design — empathy for the people you’re building for. The question now was — what can we do that will make life easier for our merchants?</p><p><em><em>Item availability?</em></em> Understood.<br><em><em>Menu updation?</em></em> Got it.<br><em><em>Pricing adjustments?</em></em> Why not.<br><em><em>Add categories?

Nadiem, Andre and Kevin have been\nrunning the business together for a number of years, which will ensure that this\nleadership transition will run smoothly.\n\nNadiem’s news was communicated in an email to all Gojek staff that was sent\ntoday. In the email, he looked back on how the company has grown over the past\nnine years and also set out his hopes for the future of the business:\n\n“We started this company with nothing, other than a deep desire to change things\nfor the better. We saw that the streets of Jakarta were a mess and that there\nwas an informal community of ojek drivers who could easily act as a huge part of\nthe solution to that mess, if only they were organised and working efficiently.\n\n“With just that initial desire to improve life for everyone, as well as a large\namount of support from countless friends, partners and stakeholders, we’ve\ncreated Gojek. An iconic company that flies the flag for the future of Indonesia\nand Southeast Asia.\n\n“I will leave Gojek in the capable hands of Andre Soelistyo and Kevin Aluwi as\nco-CEOs, both of whom have played central roles in moving the company along its\npath from that office in South Jakarta onto the global stage.\n\n“We got very lucky as we progressed along that path, but I believe that luck in\nbusiness only really becomes a valuable commodity if you have the brilliant\nminds needed to take advantage of it. Kevin and Andre have mentored me to be the\nleader I am today. They are quite simply Gojek’s best. They have been running\nthis company for a number of years and I have complete faith not just in their\ntechnical skills and ability to execute flawlessly, but also in their integrity\nand their desire to do the right thing every step of the way.\n\n“High emotions are involved in running a company like Gojek but Andre and Kevin\nare always the steady voices of reason, approaching problems with intelligence\nand compassion. I couldn’t ask for better successors as the Gojek movement\nbegins its next stage of growth.”\n\nA joint statement released by Andre and Kevin said: “When a friend and mentor\nleaves a business you have built together, there is always going to be some\nsadness, but we are both determined that Gojek will go from strength to\nstrength. We will continue to implement our vision as we focus on what the Gojek\nof the next ten years is going to be like.\n\n“This company has changed the lives of so many people in Indonesia and around\nthe region, and our key priority is to ensure that we can continue to act as a\npositive force in society for the foreseeable future.”\n\nUnder Andre and Kevin’s management, Gojek has grown exponentially, to process\nover two billion transactions a year. The company’s fundraising efforts have\nattracted some of the world’s most exciting companies including Google, Tencent,\nMitsubishi, Visa, AIA and Astra, with Series F set to raise well over US$2bn.\nThe company has also launched operations in Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam,\nwhile the Gojek app has become the most-used on-demand application in Indonesia,\nwhere its food and payments businesses have overtaken transport to become the\nlargest businesses within the group.\n\nWith the new structure, Andre will focus on corporate functions and management\nof capital allocation, international expansion as well as the payments and\nfinancial services businesses, while Kevin will focus on the product development\nelements of the Gojek business as well as marketing, organisational development\nand the transportation and food delivery businesses.\n\nSince co-founding Gojek, Kevin has held significant leadership roles across\nproduct and functional teams within the organisation.

We couldn’t\nbe more optimistic about the company’s future and its continued positive impact\nto Indonesia’s economy and society.

We have seen firsthand the leadership transition and seamless execution as they have been working closely to grow the business into the size and scale that it is today.</p><p>“I have a lot of respect for Nadiem and would definitely like to applaud him on his mission to improve lives across Indonesia and I am very confident that Gojek will continue to thrive and develop into a true global player in the capable hands of Andre and Kevin.”</p><p>—</p><p><strong><strong>Ashish Shastry, Co-Head of Asia Pacific Private Equity and Head of Southeast Asia at KKR</strong></strong> said, “Gojek has seen phenomenal expansion across verticals both in Indonesia and overseas in recent years, in large part to the company’s impressive management team and deep bench of committed and talented executives. We congratulate Andre, Kevin and Nadiem on each of their new roles within and outside Gojek, and we’re excited to see the company continue to pursue its bold vision for growth under the very capable leadership of Andre and Kevin. On a personal note, I’ve known Andre, Kevin and Nadiem from pre Gojek days and I’m very confident that they will all deliver lasting impact in their new roles.”</p><p>—</p><p><strong><strong>Shailendra Singh, Managing Director, Sequoia Capital (India) Singapore said</strong></strong>, “Andre and Kevin are both dynamic, mission-driven leaders who we have worked closely with for several years; they have played a critical role in driving Gojek’s trajectory and execution. Gojek has made an incredible impact in Indonesia since we partnered with the company in 2015, touching the lives of millions of consumers and adding billions to the country’s economy. We couldn’t be more optimistic about the company’s future and its continued positive impact to Indonesia’s economy and society. We are grateful to Nadiem for his visionary leadership of Gojek since its founding, but we are equally optimistic that Andre and Kevin will lead the company to newer heights.”</p><p><strong><strong>About Gojek:</strong></strong></p><p><a href=\"https://www.gojek.io/\" rel=\"noopener\">Gojek</a> is a Super App. It’s one app for ordering food, commuting, digital payments, shopping, hyper-local delivery, getting a massage and two dozen services.

Let’s take music as an example. It\nhelps to know the theory and to understand the mechanics of your instrument. It\nalso helps to have talent. Having a good partner to watch your back doesn’t hurt\neither. But there’s more to it.\n\nWhy are The Beatles [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles], who formed in\nLiverpool in 1960, considered one of the greatest bands in history\n[https://www.quora.com/Why-are-The-Beatles-the-greatest-band-in-history/answer/Giliana-P-Garc%C3%ADa-Acevedo-1]\n? Why doesn’t everyone else achieve the same level of success?\n\n> The difference between master and beginner is the amount of practice.\nThe Beatles applied the fundamentals they learned over and over again, using\nfeedback to get better every time. All told, they performed for 270 nights in\njust over a year-and-a-half. By the time they had their first taste of success\nin 1964, they had performed live an estimated 1,200 times. Most bands today\ndon’t perform that much in their entire career.\n\nThe 10,000 Hours rule\nIn the early 1990s, psychologist K. Anders Ericsson and two of his colleagues at\nBerlin’s elite Academy of Music conducted a study\n[http://projects.ict.usc.edu/itw/gel/EricssonDeliberatePracticePR93.PDF]. With\nthe help of the Academy, they interviewed twelve expert pianists (8 men and 4\nwomen) and 12 amateurs (7 men and 5 women).\n\nThe amateurs never practiced more than about three hours a week over the course\nof their childhood, and by the age of twenty, they had totaled two thousand\nhours of practice. The experts, on the other hand, steadily increased their\npractice time every year, until by the age of twenty, they had reached ten\nthousand hours.\n\n> “To become a chess grandmaster also seems to take about ten years. (Only the\nlegendary Bobby Fisher got to that elite level in less than that amount of time:\nit took him nine years.) And what’s ten years? Well, it’s roughly how long it\ntakes to put in ten thousand hours of hard practice. Ten thousand hours is the\nmagic number of greatness.”\n> Malcolm Gladwell, in his book “Outliers: The Story of Success\n[http://amzn.to/wgo1hw]”\nThe interesting thing about that number, of course, is that ten thousand hours\nis an enormous amount of time. It’s all but impossible to reach that number all\nby yourself by the time you’re a young adult. This would require encouraging\nparents and some measure of wealth, which would avoid the need to hold down\nadditional jobs that would eat into valuable practice time.\n\nWhat Happens in the Software Industry\nIn the software industry, we take developers trained in theory and throw them\nstraight into the deep-end, working on a project with no real precedent to draw\nfrom. It’s like taking a group of kids to fight against the big gang in the\ntown. But that is not an issue because, in software engineering, we do our\npracticing on the job, and that’s why we make mistakes on the job. But at the\nend of the day, we want to be great while still managing the objectives. For\nthat purpose, we need to find ways of splitting the practice from the\nprofession. A practice method that is effective and without taking up too much\ntime.\n\n> This is where CodeKata comes in.\nThe CodeKata\nKata [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kata] is an exercise in Karate to execute a\nspecified series of a variety of moves, with stepping and turning, while\nattempting to maintain perfect form. It teaches the student about proper form\nand position to helped them visualize different scenarios for each motion and\ntechnique. Traditionally, kata is taught in stages. Previously learned kata are\nrepeated to show better technique or power as a student acquires knowledge and\nexperience. It is common for students to repeat every kata they have learned but\nat an improved level of quality.\n\nSandy Vs. SpongebobCodeKata is an attempt to bring this element of practice to software\ndevelopment. The intent behind CodeKata is similar to Karate Kata. Each is a\nshort exercise. It repeated multiple times, adding little improvements in each\ncycle. Some involve programming and can be coded in many different ways. Some\ninvolve thinking about the issues behind programming and design. These are\nunlikely to have a single correct answer.\n\n> Remember that the point of the kata is not arriving at the correct answer. The\npoint is the stuff you learn along the way. The goal is the practice, not the\nsolution.\nHow Is This Accomplished at Gojek?\nAt Gojek, there’s a program for employees called Engineering Bootcamp\n[https://blog.gojekengineering.com/what-is-the-go-jek-engineering-bootcamp-de7778836da9]\n. Basically, it is weeks of intense hands-on learning designed to unlearn and\nequip skills needed to be a world-class engineer.\n\nCore Engineering BootcampAt Bootcamp, the way coaches taught us (participants)\nis similar to CodeKata. We have a code drill session in the afternoon to solve\none problem by using Java. After the class ends, we solve the same problem again\nas homework in the evening using Ruby. There are many things we did in our code\ndrill session, that really helped us develop in CodeKata. Those are:\n\n1. Set Rules\nWe have rules called Non-Negotiable Etiquette. If you violate one of the rules,\nyou have to rm -rf your code and start it again from scratch. What is rm -rf? It\nis a basic command on Unix system to remove files or directories from the\nmachine forever.\n\nNon Negotiable Etiquette\nIf you violate one, rm -rf! never love your code </3\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n 1.  Indentation and spacing between code constructs (classes/methods/specs)\n     must be consistent.\n 2.  Use only spaces (no tabs) for indentation.\n 3.  Newlines at end of file.\n 4.  Follow accepted naming conventions for your language/framework.\n 5.  Follow accepted naming file and Directory structure for your\n     language/framework.\n 6.  Use namespaces.\n 7.  No comments/Unused Code/Unused file/Unused folder must ever be checked in.\n 8.  Runtime environment should be consistent with IDE environment -  i.e there\n     should be no difference in running a build or a spec from your IDE and from\n     the command line.\n 9.  Use .gitignore.\n 10. Ensure there is a README.md that includes problem description, dev\n     environment setup, build instructions, and run instructions.\n 11. Test Driven Development (this should show in clear pattern in the commit\n     log - one spec, one code change per commit)\n\nCan you imagine the feeling when code that we wrote with blood and tears needs\nto be deleted for one small mistake? Is that acceptable?\n\n> Yes, you must not love your code.\nThat small mistake is not tolerable in production and even development. It could\ncause bugs, errors or other things that may become a bottleneck. But of course,\nwe don’t rm -rf in work 😂. It’s just a practice so that we don’t get overly\nattached to the code, remain careful about mistakes, and most importantly —\nmaintain quality.\n\n2. Practise Pair Programming\nAs the name implies, pair programming is where two developers work on one\nmachine. We only have a keyboard and a mouse for each pair. One developer acts\nas the driver who codes while the other serves as the observer who checks the\ncode being written, proofreads and spell-checks, and also figures out where to\ngo next. These roles can be switched at any time: the driver will then become\nthe observer and vice versa.\n\nPair Programming greatly helps us in CodeKata, because:\n\n * It’s harder to procrastinate. Working as a team means you can’t stop and\n   check your email, Slack, Facebook or WhatsApp every few minutes.\n * When someone shares a problem you are going through, you feel less defeated\n   and more positive about trying again.\n * Increases software quality without impacting much on time to deliver. It will\n   cost only 15% of the development time according to this study\n   [https://www.economist.com/technology-quarterly/2001/09/20/agility-counts].\n   But with increased quality comes big savings later in the project.\n\n3. Have a Short Cycle\nThe point of CodeKata is to get experience from practice. In order to achieve\nthat, we solve the same problem multiple times. We try different approaches and\nsolutions to experience each advantage and disadvantage. While we work on it, we\nalso try to add little improvements for every cycle. But sometimes, we can also\ntreat the cycle as an iteration of solving the problem.\n\nBecause CodeKata is a practicing method and not project development. It’s not\nsupposed to be worked on for the long run. For that reason, we only have 20–30\nmins for every cycle (sometimes even shorter).\n\nAfter the Mini Retro, we showcase our code to other participants in the class.\nWhy do we need to do it? Even though the whole class is working on the same\nproblem, we may interpret it differently and have hundreds of possible different\nsolutions. Doing a showcase will tell others about progress and approaches. It\nwill trigger a discussion and synchronize the context for everyone. At the end\nof the day, we will converge at the current best solution.\n\n> It’s similar to Agile Development. You deliver something to the customer as soon\nas possible to get feedback faster.\nA Few Final Thoughts\nMy tips for CodeKata are:\n\n * Find a place and time where you won’t be interrupted.\n * Focus on the essential elements of the Kata.\n * Remember to look for feedback for every major decision\n * If it helps, keep a journal of your progress\n * Have discussion groups with other developers, but try to have completed the\n   kata first\n\nCore Engineering BootcampThank you for reading this blog!

But there’s more to it.</p><p>Why are <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles\" rel=\"noopener\">The Beatles</a>, who formed in Liverpool in 1960, considered one of <a href=\"https://www.quora.com/Why-are-The-Beatles-the-greatest-band-in-history/answer/Giliana-P-Garc%C3%ADa-Acevedo-1\" rel=\"noopener\">the greatest bands in history</a>? Why doesn’t everyone else achieve the same level of success?</p><blockquote>The difference between master and beginner is the amount of practice.</blockquote><p>The Beatles applied the fundamentals they learned over and over again, using feedback to get better every time. All told, they performed for 270 nights in just over a year-and-a-half. By the time they had their first taste of success in 1964, they had performed live an estimated 1,200 times. Most bands today don’t perform that much in their entire career.</p><h3 id=\"the-10-000-hours-rule\">The 10,000 Hours rule</h3><p>In the early 1990s, psychologist K. Anders Ericsson and two of his colleagues at Berlin’s elite Academy of Music conducted a <a href=\"http://projects.ict.usc.edu/itw/gel/EricssonDeliberatePracticePR93.PDF\" rel=\"noopener\">study</a>. With the help of the Academy, they interviewed twelve expert pianists (8 men and 4 women) and 12 amateurs (7 men and 5 women).</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/912/1*XesRz3d5FMCzIOfm7Yk3hA.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>The amateurs never practiced more than about three hours a week over the course of their childhood, and by the age of twenty, they had totaled two thousand hours of practice. The experts, on the other hand, steadily increased their practice time every year, until by the age of twenty, they had reached ten thousand hours.</p><blockquote><em><em>“To become a chess grandmaster also seems to take about ten years. (Only the legendary Bobby Fisher got to that elite level in less than that amount of time: it took him nine years.) And what’s ten years? Well, it’s roughly how long it takes to put in ten thousand hours of hard practice. <strong><strong>Ten thousand hours</strong></strong> is the magic number of greatness.”</em></em></blockquote><blockquote><em><em>Malcolm Gladwell, in his book “<a href=\"http://amzn.to/wgo1hw\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Outliers: The Story of Success</em></a><em>”</em></em></em></blockquote><p>The interesting thing about that number, of course, is that ten thousand hours is an enormous amount of time. It’s all but impossible to reach that number all by yourself by the time you’re a young adult. This would require encouraging parents and some measure of wealth, which would avoid the need to hold down additional jobs that would eat into valuable practice time.</p><h3 id=\"what-happens-in-the-software-industry\">What Happens in the Software Industry</h3><p>In the software industry, we take developers trained in theory and throw them straight into the deep-end, working on a project with no real precedent to draw from. It’s like taking a group of kids to fight against the big gang in the town. But that is not an issue because, in software engineering, we do our practicing on the job, and that’s why we make mistakes on the job. But at the end of the day, we want to be great while still managing the objectives. For that purpose, we need to find ways of splitting the practice from the profession. A practice method that is effective and without taking up too much time.</p><blockquote><em><em>This is where CodeKata comes in.</em></em></blockquote><h3 id=\"the-codekata\">The CodeKata</h3><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kata\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong><strong>Kata</strong></strong></a> is an exercise in Karate to execute a specified series of a variety of moves, with stepping and turning, while attempting to maintain perfect form. It teaches the student about proper form and position to helped them visualize different scenarios for each motion and technique. Traditionally, kata is taught in stages. Previously learned kata are repeated to show better technique or power as a student acquires knowledge and experience. It is common for students to repeat every kata they have learned but at an improved level of quality.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/670/1*icPku4JdhwTHMvyV7uPLZw.gif\" class=\"kg-image\"><figcaption>Sandy Vs. Spongebob</figcaption></figure><p><strong><strong>CodeKata</strong></strong> is an attempt to bring this element of practice to software development. The intent behind CodeKata is similar to Karate Kata. Each is a short exercise. It repeated multiple times, adding little improvements in each cycle. Some involve programming and can be coded in many different ways. Some involve thinking about the issues behind programming and design. These are unlikely to have a single correct answer.</p><blockquote>Remember that the point of the kata is not arriving at the correct answer. The point is the stuff you learn along the way. The goal is the practice, not the solution.</blockquote><h3 id=\"how-is-this-accomplished-at-gojek\">How Is This Accomplished at Gojek?</h3><p>At Gojek, there’s a program for employees called <a href=\"https://blog.gojekengineering.com/what-is-the-go-jek-engineering-bootcamp-de7778836da9\" rel=\"noopener\">Engineering Bootcamp</a>. Basically, it is weeks of intense hands-on learning designed to unlearn and equip skills needed to be a world-class engineer.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/3840/1*uo6NJ-s_43bjcY2V_JDSPQ.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\"><figcaption>Core Engineering Bootcamp</figcaption></figure><p>At Bootcamp, the way coaches taught us (participants) is similar to CodeKata. We have a code drill session in the afternoon to solve one problem by using Java. After the class ends, we solve the same problem again as homework in the evening using Ruby. There are many things we did in our code drill session, that really helped us develop in CodeKata. Those are:</p><h3 id=\"1-set-rules\">1. Set Rules</h3><p>We have rules called <strong><strong>Non-Negotiable Etiquette</strong></strong>. If you violate one of the rules, you have to <em><em>rm -rf</em></em> your code and start it again from scratch. What is <em><em>rm -rf</em></em>? It is a basic command on Unix system to remove files or directories from the machine forever.</p><h3 id=\"non-negotiable-etiquette\">Non Negotiable Etiquette</h3><p>If you violate one, rm -rf! never love your code &lt;/3</p><hr><ol><li>Indentation and spacing between code constructs (classes/methods/specs) must be consistent.</li><li>Use only spaces (no tabs) for indentation.</li><li>Newlines at end of file.</li><li>Follow accepted naming conventions for your language/framework.</li><li>Follow accepted naming file and Directory structure for your language/framework.</li><li>Use namespaces.</li><li>No comments/Unused Code/Unused file/Unused folder must ever be checked in.</li><li>Runtime environment should be consistent with IDE environment -  i.e there should be no difference in running a build or a spec from your IDE and from the command line.</li><li>Use .gitignore.</li><li>Ensure there is a README.md that includes problem description, dev environment setup, build instructions, and run instructions.</li><li>Test Driven Development (this should show in clear pattern in the commit log - one spec, one code change per commit)</li></ol><p>Can you imagine the feeling when code that we wrote with blood and tears needs to be deleted for one small mistake? Is that acceptable?</p><blockquote>Yes, you must not love your code.</blockquote><p>That small mistake is not tolerable in production and even development. It could cause bugs, errors or other things that may become a bottleneck. But of course, we don’t <em><em>rm -rf</em></em> in work 😂. It’s just a practice so that we don’t get overly attached to the code, remain careful about mistakes, and most importantly — maintain quality.</p><h3 id=\"2-practise-pair-programming\">2. Practise Pair Programming</h3><p>As the name implies, pair programming is where two developers work on one machine. We only have a keyboard and a mouse for each pair. One developer acts as the driver who codes while the other serves as the observer who checks the code being written, proofreads and spell-checks, and also figures out where to go next. These roles can be switched at any time: the driver will then become the observer and vice versa.</p><p>Pair Programming greatly helps us in CodeKata, because:</p><ul><li>It’s harder to procrastinate. Working as a team means you can’t stop and check your email, Slack, Facebook or WhatsApp every few minutes.</li><li>When someone shares a problem you are going through, you feel less defeated and more positive about trying again.</li><li>Increases software quality without impacting much on time to deliver. It will cost only 15% of the development time according to this <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/technology-quarterly/2001/09/20/agility-counts\" rel=\"noopener\">study</a>. But with increased quality comes big savings later in the project.</li></ul><h3 id=\"3-have-a-short-cycle\">3. Have a Short Cycle</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/982/1*14PeUCfZheM8mK7xm6FL8w.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>The point of CodeKata is to get experience from practice. In order to achieve that, we solve the same problem multiple times. We try different approaches and solutions to experience each advantage and disadvantage. While we work on it, we also try to add little improvements for every cycle. But sometimes, we can also treat the cycle as an iteration of solving the problem.</p><p>Because CodeKata is a practicing method and not project development. It’s not supposed to be worked on for the long run. For that reason, we only have 20–30 mins for every cycle (sometimes even shorter).</p><p>After the Mini Retro, we showcase our code to other participants in the class. Why do we need to do it? Even though the whole class is working on the same problem, we may interpret it differently and have hundreds of possible different solutions. Doing a showcase will tell others about progress and approaches. It will trigger a discussion and synchronize the context for everyone. At the end of the day, we will converge at the current best solution.</p><blockquote>It’s similar to Agile Development. You deliver something to the customer as soon as possible to get feedback faster.</blockquote><h3 id=\"a-few-final-thoughts\">A Few Final Thoughts</h3><p>My tips for CodeKata are:</p><ul><li>Find a place and time where you won’t be interrupted.</li><li>Focus on the essential elements of the Kata.</li><li>Remember to look for feedback for every major decision</li><li>If it helps, keep a journal of your progress</li><li>Have discussion groups with other developers, but try to have completed the kata first</li></ul><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/4240/1*53r0Npq_Thb0R0saRF08Rg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\"><figcaption>Core Engineering Bootcamp</figcaption></figure><p>Thank you for reading this blog!

They help us validate our hypotheses without\nhaving to involve our entire user base. However, any good experiment first\nrequires the answer to the question — how do we know the right number of people\nto include in it?\n\nLet’s break down why this is important. If we target too few, our experiments\nwill not detect smaller effects, leading us to miss legitimate opportunities. If\nwe target too many, we would be wasting resources and potentially hurting our\nbusiness metrics (if the treatments turn out to be detrimental).\n\nPreviously, we used simple heuristics (and a mysterious formula) to estimate the\nrequired sample size. These practices were not very scientific and produced\ninconsistent experimental results. To compensate, we had to repeat the same\nexperiment multiple times just to validate the results. Sometimes different\niterations would conflict with each other, leaving everyone scratching their\nheads.\n\nLast year, we ditched those unscientific practices and built a new tool called\nSample Size Calculator (yes, imaginative name, we know). This post explains how\nthe calculator helps us find the right number of people to include in\nexperiments.\n\nOur calculator is based on Frequentist school of statistics. Under the hood, we\nused both the pwr\n[https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pwr/vignettes/pwr-vignette.html] \npackage and the base sample size calculation functions in R programming\nlanguage. This is what the tool looks like:\n\nFigure 1. Screenshot of the Sample Size Calculator used at GojekThe most\nimportant parameters are the type of dependent variable measured, the historical\ndata, and the required sensitivity from the experiment. As you can see in the\ngraph, if we increase sensitivity to allow detection of smaller effects, the\nrequired sample size soars, which makes sense.\n\nAlthough this is a major step in the right direction, there is a problem if we\nare interested in a continuous dependent variable for our experiment. This is\nbecause the underlying methodology used in the calculator assumes a normal\ndistribution, while most continuous metrics that we care about at Gojek — such\nas bookings per user — are usually skewed. By ‘skewed’, we mean that most users\nare light users and only a small percentage are heavy users. This could cause\nthe computed sample size requirement to be wrong because a key assumption was\nnot met.\n\nWe have four options to deal with this problem:\n\n 1. Use a methodology that doesn’t assume normality. Unfortunately, the\n    available non-parametric methods are complex to implement [1\n    [http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~ejohnson/regression/Sample%20Size%20Power%20Considerations.pdf]\n    ] [2 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4423589/]]\n 2. Transform data to have a normal distribution. This doesn’t always work —\n    some data just can’t be coerced to normal\n 3. Use a larger sample size. Since the worry is lower power than expected,\n    simple multiplication should boost the power, but the multiplier needs to be\n    reasonable. Figuring the right multiplier would be another beast on its own\n 4. Ignore it. This is the path we took\n\n> But but but… that’s not scientific!\nDon’t worry. We tested the robustness of this solution before going ahead with\nit.\n\nAs you can see in the graph below, we created two right-skewed distributions\nwith known 5% difference in means to serve as our populations. The plan is to\ncontinuously sample from this population (equivalent to replicating the same\nexperiment many times) and see how often we can detect this 5% difference (aka\nwhat is our “power [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_(statistics)]”).\n\nFigure 2. Two right-skewed distributions (typical shape for continuous metric at\nGojek) with known mean difference (lift) of 5%The first step is to calculate the\nrequired sample size with a power of 80% and minimum detectable effect of 5%.\nLet’s refer to this sample size requirement as the “exact” size. Then we divide\nand multiply it by three and call them “less” and “more”, respectively. For each\nsample size, we sample from the populations, compute the mean difference\n(typically called “lift”), and repeat this procedure many times.\n\nThe resulting distributions of lifts are shown below. The coloured vertical\nlines show the average lift of each experimental size, which is also equal to\nthe actual population lift. This is central limit theorem\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem] at work. What is\ninteresting are the relative shapes of the sampling distributions. The “more”\ngroup is the safest and most consistent but the “exact” group seems to have good\naccuracy with only a third of the sample size. In the “less” group, we even see\na non-negligible number of lifts that are negative, even though we know the\npopulation lift is actually +5%. This is in line with our intuition that larger\nsample size is generally more trustworthy than a smaller one, all else being\nequal.\n\nFigure 3. Sampling distribution of the mean difference from each size groupSince\nwe currently report the statistical significance of our experimental results at\nGojek, we will also run t-test for each of our sample here.\n\nAs it turns out, 80.4% of the experiments in the “exact” group have\nstatistically significant results (p < 0.05), which is almost equal to the 80%\npower we set in the sample size calculator. In layman’s terms, the tool roughly\npromised that if you run the experiment with this sample size, you have 80%\nchance of detecting a 5% lift (the minimum detectable effect) if it’s there.\n\nSince it kept its promise even on non-normally distributed data, we can conclude\nthat the methodology is robust to some degree of violation of the normality\nassumption. Therefore we can ignore it until otherwise proven.\n\nFigure 4. Percentage of samples/experiments with statistically significant\nresults (p < 0.05) from each size groupMeanwhile, the “less” group had only ~34%\nstatistically significant results, suggesting that we shouldn’t run an\nexperiment if we cannot fulfil the sample size requirement — since we risk not\nbeing able to detect an existing effect. With the “more” group having close to\n100% statistically significant results, we again reaffirm that larger sample\nsize is generally a good thing if we can afford it.\n\nSince it was deployed in mid-2018, many teams across Gojek have adopted the\nSample Size Calculator. So far, nearly 1,000 experiments have incorporated this\ntool in their designs, and it is also a part of Litmus, our experimentation\nplatform\n[https://blog.gojekengineering.com/introducing-litmus-gojeks-own-experimentation-platform-3803467b6a53]\n. The more critical takeaway for us is that the experiments run using the\nrecommended sample sizes have similar results when full-scaled. This fact has\nenabled us to iterate faster and cut waste while maintaining a high degree of\nconfidence in the experimental results. ✌️\n\nDid we mention Gojek’s Growth team is hiring analysts?

At Gojek, we handle more than 3 million\norders a day across our 20+ products.\n\nAs you can imagine, the number of push notifications we send are proportionally\nlarge — about a million every hour to be exact.This post describes the\nchallenges we faced while working with such high notification volumes, and the\nsolutions we developed to solve them.\n\nVolume is only one part of the problem, many additional challenges were somewhat\nunique to Gojek:\n\n1. Multiple applications\nGojek isn’t comprised of just a single app. In addition to the Gojek app for\ncustomers, we also have GoLife, as well as our driver apps, merchant apps, and\nservice provider apps for GoLife.\n\nWhen one of our systems wants to send a notification, it could be for a specific\napplication of a user (for example, we don’t want to send GoLife booking\nnotifications to the Gojek app), or for all applications (for example, a\npromotional notification).\n\nOur system needed to be flexible enough to choose between an option to broadcast\nthe notification to all applications, or to a specific application.\n\n2. Multiple notification providers\nSince we support both iOS and Android for our customer applications, we needed\nto support multiple notification systems.\n\nFor Android devices, we have FCM (Firebase Cloud Messaging) and the deprecated\nGCM (Google Cloud Messaging) API. For iOS, we have APNS (Apple Push Notification\nservice).\n\nEach notification provider has different API keys and tokens for different\napplication IDs. For example, the FCM API key would be different for GoLife as\nopposed to Gojek.\n\n3. Multiple devices per user\nWe allow our users to stay signed in to multiple devices at a time. For us, this\nalso means that any push notification sent to the user must be sent to all of\nthe devices that the user is currently logged into.\n\nThis is also a combination of the previous two problems:\n\n 1. The user can be logged into multiple applications on a single device (Gojek\n    + GoLife)\n 2. The user may be logged into different devices, where each device requires a\n    different push notification provider. For example, a user can be logged into\n    Gojek on their Android, as well as iOS device.\n\n4. Multiple services that want to send notifications\nGojek uses a micro-service architecture, where the services of each of our\nproducts need to send notifications to our users.\n\nWe want to make it as easy as possible for any service to be able to send a\nnotification, without worrying about the multiple devices and providers that we\ndiscussed.\n\nPush notification service architecture\n\nIn order to address the above challenges, and make sure that the API remains as\nsimple as possible, we built our notification system as three components:\n\n 1. Notification server — exposes the API to send notifications, and pushes it\n    as a job on our job queue\n 2. Token store — stores the devices and devices tokens of all the currently\n    logged-in users\n 3. Notification worker — consumes jobs on the job queue and sends notifications\n    via the notification providers.\n\nEach component abstracts away some part of the problems we discussed above.\nLet’s take a look at each part in more detail:\n\n1. Token store\nOnce a user is logged into our application, the application makes a call to the\ntoken store API with their device token and application ID.\n\n\nThis entry is then removed when the user logs out.\n\n> The token store abstracts the process of deciding which devices to send a\nnotification to for each user\n2. Notification server\nThis is an HTTP server that exposes an API internally to send notifications.\n\nIn order to make things simple, the API accepts the user ID, and an optional\napplication ID as HTTP headers, and notification information in the request\nbody:\n\nPOST http://<base_url>/notification\nuser_id: <user_id>\napplication_id: <application_id>\n\n{\n\"payload\": {},\n\"title\": \"You driver is here\",\n\"message\": \"Please meet your driver at the pickup point\"\n}\n\nThe server fetches all of the users devices from the token store, and schedules\na job for each of the users devices.\n\n> The notification server abstracts the external interface to the system. Now,\nother services in Gojek that need to send out a notification just need to call\nour API with the user ID, and the system takes care of the rest\n3. Job Queue\nWe use RabbitMQ as an exchange for our job queues. We have a queue for each\napplication ID and provider type.\n\n\nThis is important because we want to isolate failures for each application and\nprovider type. For example, if our FCM token expires for com.gojek.app, we don't\nwant to stall the jobs for com.gojek.life or com.gojek.driver.bike.\n\n4. Notification workers\n\nThe worker processes consume messages from the job queues, and send out messages\nto the respective notification providers.\n\nIn order to make our code simpler, and to accommodate different service\nproviders if needed, we make use of interfaces to abstract the functionality\nimplemented by each provider:\n\ntype PushService interface {\nPush(ctx context.Context, m PushRequest) (PushResponse, error)\n}\n\nThe Push method takes a request object and returns a response object.\n\nThe request structure contains information related to the recipient and\nadditional options about the notification, like expiry time, title and text:\n\ntype PushRequest struct {\nDeviceID   string \nTitle      string\nMessage    string\nPayload    map[string]interface{}\n//some other parameters omitted\n}\n\nThe response contains information on whether the notification was sent to the\nprovider’s server successfully:\n\ntype PushResponse struct {\nSuccess         bool\nErrorMsg        string\n}\nWe then implement the interface for specific providers. For example, the code\nfor Google FCM provider, and Apples APNS provider looks something like this:\n\ntype FCMProvider struct {\n// configuration for our provider, like API token and URL endpoint\n}func (p *FCMProvider) Push(ctx context.Context, m queue.Message)\n(notification.PushResponse, error) {\n// code to send a notification payload to FCMs server\n}type APNSProvider struct {\n// configuration for our provider, like API token and URL endpoint\n}func (p *APNSProvider) Push(ctx context.Context, m queue.Message)\n(notification.PushResponse, error) {\n// code to send a notification payload to FCMs server\n}\n\n> The notification worker abstracts the process of selecting the correct provider\nto send the notification. It selects the correct provider, with the correct API\nkey based on the application ID of the message received from the queue.\nConclusion\nBy finding common patterns in the challenges we faced, and abstracting them into\ntheir own services, we turned a relatively complex problem into a suite of\nservices that are reasonably straightforward and easy to manage on their own.\n\nEach time we found a point which needed to handle multiple implementations of\nthe same core logic, we put it behind a dedicated service:\n\n 1. Multiple devices for a user was put behind the token service\n 2. Multiple applications were given a common interface on notification server\n 3. Multiple providers were handled by individual job queues and notification\n    workers\n\nIn the end, we wound up with a system that can comfortably handle over a million\nnotifications every hour.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWant more updates on how we build scalable systems for Southeast Asia’s\n#SuperApp?

Multiple applications</h1><p>Gojek isn’t comprised of just a single app. In addition to the Gojek app for customers, we also have GoLife, as well as our driver apps, merchant apps, and service provider apps for GoLife.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/882/1*LydaxXs7dKWE8OvGt7Opnw.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>When one of our systems wants to send a notification, it could be for a specific application of a user (for example, we don’t want to send GoLife booking notifications to the Gojek app), or for all applications (for example, a promotional notification).</p><p>Our system needed to be flexible enough to choose between an option to broadcast the notification to all applications, or to a specific application.</p><h1 id=\"2-multiple-notification-providers\">2. Multiple notification providers</h1><p>Since we support both iOS and Android for our customer applications, we needed to support multiple notification systems.</p><p>For Android devices, we have FCM (Firebase Cloud Messaging) and the deprecated GCM (Google Cloud Messaging) API. For iOS, we have APNS (Apple Push Notification service).</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/962/1*gx05-ArzDJLasMbmiOmiqA.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>Each notification provider has different API keys and tokens for different application IDs. For example, the FCM API key would be different for GoLife as opposed to Gojek.</p><h1 id=\"3-multiple-devices-per-user\">3. Multiple devices per user</h1><p>We allow our users to stay signed in to multiple devices at a time. For us, this also means that any push notification sent to the user must be sent to all of the devices that the user is currently logged into.</p><p>This is also a combination of the previous two problems:</p><ol><li>The user can be logged into multiple applications on a single device (Gojek + GoLife)</li><li>The user may be logged into different devices, where each device requires a different push notification provider. For example, a user can be logged into Gojek on their Android, as well as iOS device.</li></ol><h1 id=\"4-multiple-services-that-want-to-send-notifications\">4. Multiple services that want to send notifications</h1><p>Gojek uses a micro-service architecture, where the services of each of our products need to send notifications to our users.</p><p>We want to make it as easy as possible for any service to be able to send a notification, without worrying about the multiple devices and providers that we discussed.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/501/1*6IaF4_PwdHWk6RowO0OnoA.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>Push notification service architecture</p><p>In order to address the above challenges, and make sure that the API remains as simple as possible, we built our notification system as three components:</p><ol><li><strong><strong>Notification server</strong></strong> — exposes the API to send notifications, and pushes it as a job on our job queue</li><li><strong><strong>Token store</strong></strong> — stores the devices and devices tokens of all the currently logged-in users</li><li><strong><strong>Notification worker</strong></strong> — consumes jobs on the job queue and sends notifications via the notification providers.</li></ol><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1902/1*2Nmx4MeYAXgekpr3uD8dng.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>Each component abstracts away some part of the problems we discussed above. Let’s take a look at each part in more detail:</p><h2 id=\"1-token-store\">1. Token store</h2><p>Once a user is logged into our application, the application makes a call to the token store API with their device token and application ID.<br></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/2014/1*UoYZSCamWMlz5DcK7fJ9zQ.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>This entry is then removed when the user logs out.</p><blockquote><em><em>The token store abstracts the process of deciding which devices to send a notification to for each user</em></em></blockquote><h2 id=\"2-notification-server\">2. Notification server</h2><p>This is an HTTP server that exposes an API internally to send notifications.</p><p>In order to make things simple, the API accepts the user ID, and an optional application ID as HTTP headers, and notification information in the request body:</p><p><code>POST http://&lt;base_url&gt;/notification<br>user_id: &lt;user_id&gt;<br>application_id: &lt;application_id&gt;</code></p><p><code>{<br>\t\"payload\": {},<br>\t\"title\": \"You driver is here\",<br>\t\"message\": \"Please meet your driver at the pickup point\"<br>}</code></p><p>The server fetches all of the users devices from the token store, and schedules a job for each of the users devices.</p><blockquote><em><em>The notification server abstracts the external interface to the system. Now, other services in Gojek that need to send out a notification just need to call our API with the user ID, and the system takes care of the rest</em></em></blockquote><h2 id=\"3-job-queue\">3. Job Queue</h2><p>We use RabbitMQ as an exchange for our job queues. We have a queue for each application ID and provider type.<br></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1832/1*Mg8xAvNt3o_6W7syBRst-w.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>This is important because we want to isolate failures for each application and provider type. For example, if our FCM token expires for <code>com.gojek.app</code>, we don't want to stall the jobs for <code>com.gojek.life</code> or <code>com.gojek.driver.bike</code>.</p><p>4. Notification workers</p><p>The worker processes consume messages from the job queues, and send out messages to the respective notification providers.</p><p>In order to make our code simpler, and to accommodate different service providers if needed, we make use of interfaces to abstract the functionality implemented by each provider:</p><p><code>type PushService interface {<br>\tPush(ctx context.Context, m PushRequest) (PushResponse, error)<br>}</code></p><p>The <code>Push</code> method takes a request object and returns a response object.</p><p>The request structure contains information related to the recipient and additional options about the notification, like expiry time, title and text:</p><p><code>type PushRequest struct {<br>\tDeviceID   string <br>\tTitle      string<br>\tMessage    string<br>\tPayload    map[string]interface{}<br><em><em>//some other parameters omitted</em></em><br>}</code></p><p>The response contains information on whether the notification was sent to the provider’s server successfully:</p><p><code>type PushResponse struct {<br>\tSuccess         bool<br>\tErrorMsg        string<br>}</code><br>We then implement the interface for specific providers. For example, the code for Google FCM provider, and Apples APNS provider looks something like this:</p><p><code>type FCMProvider struct {<br>\t<em><em>// configuration for our provider, like API token and URL endpoint</em></em><br>}func (p *FCMProvider) Push(ctx context.Context, m queue.Message) (notification.PushResponse, error) {<br>\t<em><em>// code to send a notification payload to FCMs server</em></em><br>}type APNSProvider struct {<br>\t<em><em>// configuration for our provider, like API token and URL endpoint</em></em><br>}func (p *APNSProvider) Push(ctx context.Context, m queue.Message) (notification.PushResponse, error) {<br>\t<em><em>// code to send a notification payload to FCMs server</em></em><br>}</code></p><blockquote><em><em>The notification worker abstracts the process of selecting the correct provider to send the notification. It selects the correct provider, with the correct API key based on the application ID of the message received from the queue.</em></em></blockquote><h1 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h1><p>By finding common patterns in the challenges we faced, and abstracting them into their own services, we turned a relatively complex problem into a suite of services that are reasonably straightforward and easy to manage on their own.</p><p>Each time we found a point which needed to handle multiple implementations of the same core logic, we put it behind a dedicated service:</p><ol><li>Multiple devices for a user was put behind the token service</li><li>Multiple applications were given a common interface on notification server</li><li>Multiple providers were handled by individual job queues and notification workers</li></ol><p>In the end, we wound up with a system that can comfortably handle <strong><strong>over a million notifications every hour</strong></strong>.</p><hr><p>Want more updates on how we build scalable systems for Southeast Asia’s #SuperApp? <a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/go-jek/gojek-tech-newsletter\" rel=\"noopener\">Sign up for our newsletter!</a></p>","url":"https://gojek-ghost.zysk.in/how-we-manage-a-million-push-notifications-an-hour/","canonical_url":null,"uuid":"b9ad7304-57c6-4ff7-9a4e-6424cb767b77","page":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_styles":null,"comment_id":"5ec2af987aa22c4066f83ac4","reading_time":5}}]},"tags":{"edges":[{"node":{"name":"Culture","slug":"culture"}},{"node":{"name":"Data","slug":"data"}},{"node":{"name":"Design","slug":"design"}},{"node":{"name":"News","slug":"news"}},{"node":{"name":"Stories","slug":"stories"}},{"node":{"name":"Tech","slug":"tech"}},{"node":{"name":"Funding","slug":"funding"}},{"node":{"name":"Gojek","slug":"gojek"}},{"node":{"name":"Program Management","slug":"program-management"}},{"node":{"name":"Project Management","slug":"project-management"}},{"node":{"name":"Scrum","slug":"scrum"}},{"node":{"name":"Startup","slug":"startup"}}]}},"pageContext":{"pageNumber":1,"humanPageNumber":2,"skip":12,"limit":12,"numberOfPages":4,"previousPagePath":"articles/all","nextPagePath":"/page/3"}}}
