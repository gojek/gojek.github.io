Then we’ll talk about how we tackle running batch processing jobs and\nhandling scheduling dependencies.\n\nData Warehouse setup\nAt Gojek, we use Google Bigquery (BQ) as a Data Warehouse. All data points\nranging from booking and searches to location are published in real time using \nBeast [https://github.com/gojek/beast], our open-sourced tool.\n\nWe also push data from Kafka to our data lake, which is Google Cloud\nStorage(GCS).

On each trigger of a batch job, we create an\nephemeral cluster to run the job, which means that the cluster is destroyed\nafter the batch job completes.\n\nThe batch job is written in Pyspark\n[https://spark.apache.org/docs/2.2.0/api/python/pyspark.html], which all our\nanalysts are familiar with. This provides a good interface to interact with\nSpark Dataframes.\n\nScheduling Dependencies between Jobs\nAs the Spark jobs become more complex and handle many responsibilities, it\nbecomes important to break them down into simpler jobs that can be better\nmanaged.\n\n> But this breakdown brings more challenges.\nWe now have to make sure the related jobs are scheduled taking in mind the\nscheduling dependencies between different jobs.\n\nFor example:\nIf there are two jobs, the first one calculates the last 6 months of order\nhistory and the second job uses the order history to calculate the preferred\nlocations from which the customer has ordered, it becomes important to run the\nfirst job and then schedule the second job.\n\nOur solution to handle such scheduling dependencies is to use Apache Airflow\n[https://airflow.apache.org/].

Simple. 🙂\n\nWith Airflow, we are also able to assign retries for each job. In the instance\nof a job failing, Airflow will rerun the job by itself.\n\nAs a final precaution, we have also added Slack integration and StatsD metrics\nwith Airflow, in order to get alerts for when the jobs have failed and need to\nbe fixed.\n\nSo that’s all for this post.

All our tests and questions are designed to\nidentify a few common traits:\n\n> In a nutshell, we’re biased towards developers who are hands-on and can code;\nirrespective of their prior experience and pedigree.\nAnother interesting fact: according to our internal data, a whopping 50% of\ncandidates who go through our interview process fail the first test assignment\nround. 😮\n\nI was surprised to see candidates from top product companies unable to get\nthrough this round.\n\nAfter looking at this daunting drop-off data, and acknowledging that we were\nvery new to Gojek’s hiring process, we decided to take baby steps. The goal: \nhire 1 engineer for GoFood. We also set up some key results to track back\ntowards our objective.\n\nCrafting A Solution\nWe knew we needed to find top developers who could make it through our\nrecruitment process, and then reach out to them to check if they would be\ninterested in joining us.\n\n> So we made this theme a problem statement, and divided it into two parts:\n> 1. Discover\n> 2. Nurture\nAs a first step, we pulled out profiles of engineers we hired from Lever (our\nApplication Tracking Service) and found many of them to be active on\ncode-related online digital platforms that reflect their passion for\nprogramming.\n\n> We finally knew where to start looking for our needle.\nOur first stop was the most obvious one — Github. Then we went to StackOverflow\nand finally, Twitter. StackOverflow itself hosts over 10 million developers.\n\nStackOverflow StatsThere’s a lot of publicly available information on these\nplatforms, so we wrote a bunch of scripts to pull info about developers from\nGithub and StackOverflow. Then we tried to map their skills, contributions,\npopularity, and activities.\n\nWe wrote custom algorithms for Github and StackOverflow to classify developers\nas qualified and unqualified, based on the criteria we were looking for. We\nlooked at various signals to check their passion for programming, and they\npassed a certain pre-defined threshold, we would mark them as qualified.\n\nOnce a candidate is qualified, we needed to categorise them based on skills,\nexperience, location, and other parameters. This step also involved some manual\nwork to clean up the data.\n\nIn order to meet our first objective, we picked around 800 candidates and\nreached out to them through personalised email campaigns. Since our team was\nquite comfortable using Python, we used Python on top of PostgreSQL to write the\nNurture system to run these email campaigns (despite Python not being part of\nGojek’s core tech stack).\n\nThe Discover <> Nurture FlowSmelling success\nAfter rigorous follow-ups, we ended up getting a decent number of interested\ncandidates, whom we then contacted for exploratory conversations.\n\nThis was quite the enlightening experience — and we realised Gojek is perceived\nas a highly tech-oriented company among developers.\n\n> Over 62% of the candidates who submitted the test assignment cleared it, and by\nthe time we finished the first cohort, we ended up hiring 3 devs.\nWe exceeded our target by 300%. 🙌\n\nThe smile of successAutomation FTW\nAs we succeeded in demonstrating the viability of our MVP, we had to look at the\nproblem statement again and translate it into a scalable system. Tackling scale\nhas always been a part of Gojek’s journey to #SuperApp status, so we decided to\nbe prepared.\n\nWhile scaling the Candidate Discovery Process, we ran into two issues:\n\n 1. Since the discovery level was managed on spreadsheets, it required a massive\n    manual effort to keep the data unique between each service.\n 2. Getting candidate info from different sources required a lot of data-sharing\n    on multiple platforms. The result — repetitive processes and data\n    duplication. 🤦‍♂️\n\nConsidering these challenges, we divided the process into 3 different layers:\n\n 1. Service layer: Contains individual micro-service which has single behaviour\n    — fetch details from a specific source and score, classify, and merge them\n    based on the data available on different mediums about a candidate.\n 2. Messaging layer: At any point in time, any individual service can connect to\n    other services to fetch more information about the candidate. For instance,\n    while parsing StackOverflow users, we get the user’s website and Github\n    URLs. So, the StackOverflow service will publish candidate’s Github social\n    id and website URL to the Github and WebScrapper services respectively. This\n    information about the candidate is then written to the database.\n 3. Data layer: It is a centralised MongoDB that stores all the data (even if\n    it’s incomplete) from different sources, which can further be pushed to\n    Nurture once it is verified.\n\nWe also dockerized all these micro-services, integrated monitoring (Prometheus),\nSlack alerts & logging (Barito [https://github.com/BaritoLog/wiki] — thanks to\nour Barito team for offering a powerful logging system).\n\nWith this automated system, we processed over 38,000 tech candidates’ profiles\nin a very short time, and found around 10,000 qualified candidates who passed\nour custom criteria.\n\nThis was our Aha! Moment.\n\nWith automation, we managed to make 13 offers to developers in a very short span\nof time, 6 of whom have already joined us.\n\nLaunching Fount\nSo far we had been the customers of our own product. But this needed to be\nbigger. We needed to get our product out to our internal recruiters to use.\n\n> However, there was one problem.\nThe Nurture system was written in Python, and we primarily use Ruby, Go, Java,\nand Clojure at Gojek. When you rely on tech stack not extensively used by the\nlarger org, you end up building your own tooling systems to test and deploy on\nthe existing infrastructure (which is already stable and working for other\nteams).\n\nTherefore, we decided to re-write the Nurture system in Clojure. I had prior\nexperience of writing programs in Common Lisp & Clojure. To my surprise, the\nteam was also excited to try out functional programming (I will soon write a\nseparate article on our experience in building API in Clojure. Pinky promise!).\n\nThere were a few hiccups in getting things moving around the infra and security\nsystems, but that was a given considering we were fairly new to the existing\ninfrastructure. We built the Nurture API in Clojure and a frontend in Reactjs.\nIn 30 days, we were up and running with our product.\n\n> We call it Fount.\nFount lists all the qualified discovered candidates; leads our recruiters can\nthen follow up on to check their interest and move into our hiring funnel.\nCurrently, a few beta users (our internal tech recruiters) are trying out the\nsystem. 🖖\n\nWe have already redesigned Fount and this is how it looks now. Thanks to Asphalt\n[https://asphalt.gojek.io/]— our very own design system at Gojek.\n\nAI Powered Candidate Discovery PlatformThe Way Forward\nThis was just the first step in our journey of streamlining recruitment at\nGojek. We’re planning to improve our sourcing algorithms, find new sources,\nimprove the candidate verification process, and build new features on Fount.\n\nWe’re also going to attack different tech recruiting problems and bring\nautomation wherever possible in order to hire top developers (and offer up a\ngreat candidate experience).\n\nThat’s all from us for now.

To achieve our task of finding top developers, we would need the superhuman power of attraction.</p><h3 id=\"testing-our-powers\">Testing Our Powers</h3><p>Gojek has a rigorous interview process, and we are picky about who we hire, to the point where even people outside of Gojek know how tough it is to get in.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Hoardings, Metro Wraps, Radio Ads by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gojektech?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@gojektech</a> to hire in Gurgaon are hard to miss - <br>and have heard that their selection process is one of the rigorous ones so don’t assume they are desperate to hire anyone who applies 😄</p>&mdash; deepakabbot (@deepakabbot) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/deepakabbot/status/1176710364030881797?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 25, 2019</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n</figure><p>We did get one key takeaway though.

Discover</em></em></em></blockquote><blockquote><em><em><em>2. Nurture</em></em></em></blockquote><p>As a first step, we pulled out profiles of engineers we hired from Lever (our Application Tracking Service) and found many of them to be active on code-related online digital platforms that reflect their passion for programming.</p><blockquote>We finally knew where to start looking for our needle.</blockquote><p>Our first stop was the most obvious one — Github. Then we went to StackOverflow and finally, Twitter. StackOverflow itself hosts over 10 million developers.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://gojek-ghost.zysk.in/content/images/2020/05/1_KbHxqGC8qosP6HE99pLzKQ.png\" class=\"kg-image\"><figcaption><em>StackOverflow Stats</em></figcaption></figure><p>There’s a lot of publicly available information on these platforms, so we wrote a bunch of scripts to pull info about developers from Github and StackOverflow. Then we tried to map their skills, contributions, popularity, and activities.</p><p>We wrote custom algorithms for Github and StackOverflow to classify developers as qualified and unqualified, based on the criteria we were looking for. We looked at various signals to check their passion for programming, and they passed a certain pre-defined threshold, we would mark them as qualified.</p><p>Once a candidate is qualified, we needed to categorise them based on skills, experience, location, and other parameters. This step also involved some manual work to clean up the data.</p><p>In order to meet our first objective, we picked around 800 candidates and reached out to them through personalised email campaigns. Since our team was quite comfortable using Python, we used Python on top of PostgreSQL to write the Nurture system to run these email campaigns (despite Python not being part of Gojek’s core tech stack).</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://gojek-ghost.zysk.in/content/images/2020/05/1_GHx2ht682c0V23r-Bk5pvA.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\"><figcaption>The Discover &lt;&gt; Nurture Flow</figcaption></figure><h3 id=\"smelling-success\">Smelling success</h3><p>After rigorous follow-ups, we ended up getting a decent number of interested candidates, whom we then contacted for exploratory conversations.</p><p>This was quite the enlightening experience — and we realised Gojek is perceived as a highly tech-oriented company among developers.</p><blockquote>Over 62% of the candidates who submitted the test assignment cleared it, and by the time we finished the first cohort, we ended up hiring 3 devs.</blockquote><p>We exceeded our target by 300%. 🙌</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://gojek-ghost.zysk.in/content/images/2020/05/1_rjDDcWnOZeFFDRZdM-FCdQ.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\"><figcaption>The smile of success</figcaption></figure><h3 id=\"automation-ftw\">Automation FTW</h3><p>As we succeeded in demonstrating the viability of our MVP, we had to look at the problem statement again and translate it into a scalable system. Tackling scale has always been a part of Gojek’s journey to #SuperApp status, so we decided to be prepared.</p><p>While scaling the Candidate Discovery Process, we ran into two issues:</p><ol><li>Since the discovery level was managed on spreadsheets, it required a massive manual effort to keep the data unique between each service.</li><li>Getting candidate info from different sources required a lot of data-sharing on multiple platforms. The result — repetitive processes and data duplication. 🤦‍♂️</li></ol><p>Considering these challenges, we divided the process into 3 different layers:</p><ol><li><strong><strong>Service layer:</strong></strong> Contains individual micro-service which has single behaviour — fetch details from a specific source and score, classify, and merge them based on the data available on different mediums about a candidate.</li><li><strong><strong>Messaging layer:</strong></strong> At any point in time, any individual service can connect to other services to fetch more information about the candidate. For instance, while parsing StackOverflow users, we get the user’s website and Github URLs. So, the StackOverflow service will publish candidate’s Github social id and website URL to the Github and WebScrapper services respectively. This information about the candidate is then written to the database.</li><li><strong><strong>Data layer:</strong></strong> It is a centralised MongoDB that stores all the data (even if it’s incomplete) from different sources, which can further be pushed to Nurture once it is verified.</li></ol><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"https://gojek-ghost.zysk.in/content/images/2020/05/1_Aw3fPTBAj5YMdP5N2zQy9A.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>We also dockerized all these micro-services, integrated monitoring (Prometheus), Slack alerts &amp; logging (<a href=\"https://github.com/BaritoLog/wiki\" rel=\"noopener\">Barito</a> — thanks to our Barito team for offering a powerful logging system).</p><p>With this automated system, we processed over 38,000 tech candidates’ profiles in a very short time, and found around 10,000 qualified candidates who passed our custom criteria.</p><p><strong><strong><em><em>This was our Aha! Moment.</em></em></strong></strong></p><p>With automation, we managed to make 13 offers to developers in a very short span of time, 6 of whom have already joined us.</p><h3 id=\"launching-fount\">Launching Fount</h3><p>So far we had been the customers of our own product. But this needed to be bigger. We needed to get our product out to our internal recruiters to use.</p><blockquote>However, there was one problem.</blockquote><p>The Nurture system was written in Python, and we primarily use Ruby, Go, Java, and Clojure at Gojek. When you rely on tech stack not extensively used by the larger org, you end up building your own tooling systems to test and deploy on the existing infrastructure (which is already stable and working for other teams).</p><p>Therefore, we decided to re-write the Nurture system in Clojure. I had prior experience of writing programs in Common Lisp &amp; Clojure. To my surprise, the team was also excited to try out functional programming (I will soon write a separate article on our experience in building API in Clojure. Pinky promise!).</p><p>There were a few hiccups in getting things moving around the infra and security systems, but that was a given considering we were fairly new to the existing infrastructure. We built the Nurture API in Clojure and a frontend in Reactjs. In 30 days, we were up and running with our product.</p><blockquote>We call it Fount.</blockquote><p>Fount lists all the qualified discovered candidates; leads our recruiters can then follow up on to check their interest and move into our hiring funnel. Currently, a few beta users (our internal tech recruiters) are trying out the system. 🖖</p><p>We have already redesigned Fount and this is how it looks now.

GoFood — Gojek’s food\ndelivery product — lists 400,000+ merchants. You search for the outlet you want\nto order from, select the item and quantity, check out, and pay either via cash\nor Gojek’s digital wallet GoPay. Then, you sit back and watch the little Gojek\ndriver partner on the screen zoom their way to the restaurant, and bring you\nsome fried banana goodness. 😍\n\nSimple. Fast. Reliable.\n\n> Rewind a few years, and things didn’t look so good.\nFirst, some context\nWhen GoFood launched in 2015, expansion and adoption happened rapidly. The\norders started piling in, and we were struggling to keep up with demand.\nInitially, we’d simply list food merchants on our marketplace, send demand their\nway, and fulfil it through our fleet of driver partners.\n\nWe were building for our consumers and driver partners, but merchants were\nalways a key component of our ecosystem. If Gojek is an iceberg, the\nconsumer-facing Super App is the part above water. In this story, we’ll dive\nbeneath the surface to explore another key component — GoBiz, our merchant\nSuperApp.\n\n> But before GoBiz, there was GoResto.\nThe Merchant Problem\nIf we had ordered ourselves that pisang goreng in the early days of GoFood,\nthings would have worked very differently.\n\nYou see, merchants were onboarded by the GoFood team by uploading their menus to\nour systems. We’d look through these menus to find our fried banana of choice,\nand make an order, which would be relayed directly to a driver partner. This\npartner would then go to the restaurant and place the order (which is when the\nmerchant partner gets involved in the process).\n\nSo, while our bananas are fried, the driver partner would wait around, and when\nthe order is ready, pay in cash. The problem with this approach was that there\nwas no record of the transaction besides a booking on GoFood and a receipt\nhanded to the driver partner.\n\nThis was an inefficient system, for driver partners, and our customers.\n\n> Oh, and those merchants? Things weren’t rosy for them either.\nLet’s assume our pisang goreng place is a GoFood partner (meaning Gojek collects\ncommissions for the increased demand we send their way), and also part of a\nlarger chain. When we place the order, GoFood will assign it to one outlet of\nthe chain. However, our driver partner may decide to visit another outlet and\npick up the order from there.\n\nAt the end of the month, our restaurant partners would be invoiced for\ncommission that was due to us, based on sales as reported by the GoFood app.\nThis meant we were charging some merchants commission for sales their outlet may\nhave never made.\n\nWe spent a lot of time and resources addressing merchant complaints. 🤦‍♂️\n\n> Then there was the matter of control.\nIf a merchant partner was not open for business on a particular day, wanted to\nupdate their menu, or indicate items as out of stock, they had to call Gojek\nCustomer Care. During this time, orders might still be coming in.\n\nLet’s just say we weren’t doing ourselves any favours. 🤷🏻‍♂️\n\nThere was a lot that needed fixing here, and it could only be done by\nintegrating merchants more deeply into our ecosystem. So that’s what we did.\n\nThe birth of GoResto\nTowards the end of 2016, a concept was developed for an app that would cater to\nGoFood merchant partners, and by early 2017 GoResto — which is what we called it\nat the time — was ready. You can read more about the product research process\nthat went into making GoResto here\n[https://blog.gojekengineering.com/whats-cooking-diving-into-kitchens-for-go-biz-e01051bfdc98]\n).\n\nWith GoResto, we addressed some of the problems outlined earlier.\n\n1. Electronic payments\nAll of Gojek’s driver partners had GoPay e-wallets associated with their\naccounts. With GoResto, we did the same for GoFood merchants. Transactions\nbetween driver and merchant partners would now be wallet-to-wallet, not cash.\nGojek would deduct any applicable commission immediately from the merchant\nwallet. This made the reconciliation process with merchants simpler.\n\n2. PIN exchange for restaurant verification\nTo eliminate fraud, driver partners would also need to share a PIN with the\nmerchant while picking up the order. This electronic handshake helped us verify\nthey were indeed picking up the right order from the right outlet.\n\nIt was a decent solution. If all went according to plan, we could breathe easy.\n\n> As you might have guessed, all did not go according to plan. 🙇‍♂️\nIn the first iteration, the wallet creation process required collaboration with\nthe GoPay team, which was itself facing bandwidth constraints due to rapid\ngrowth (which we’ll talk about a little later).\n\nAlso, the merchant onboarding to GoResto at this point was still a manual\nprocess. In our first month, we onboarded only 26 merchants. 😣\n\nWe needed a more scalable solution.\n\nHere’s a quick note on Gojek company culture. When the chips are down, it’s\nimportant for organisations to have core values to guide decision-making. One of\nour values happens to be:\n\nThis line is an affirmation to all stakeholders to take the best decision for a\nparticular situation based on available information. Such decisions are then\nrespected by everyone else.\n\nWe made two drastic decisions:\n\n 1. Merchant onboarding was completely frozen until we could build a platform to\n    automate the process.\n 2. Engineers from the Merchants team were embedded within GoPay, building\n    required capacities on GoPay systems while core GoPay engineers continued\n    work on scaling the platform.\n\n> In three months, as summer rolled around, GoResto was back.\nWe weren’t out of the woods yet though. All this was happening before Gojek had\ndeprecated its legacy codebase, Stan Marsh\n[https://blog.gojekengineering.com/thank-you-stan-marsh-29db553544bf], in favour\nof microservices, so system stability was not exactly excellent. As a result, we\nstill faced sync issues between GoFood and GoResto order management systems.\nThis, in turn, began to reflect on us publicly.\n\nOur app store rating at this point slid down to 3.2.\n\nMake It Work, Then Make It Better\nWe clearly had a long way to go to make GoResto the app our merchants deserved.\nThings were bad, but as they say — sometimes the only way out is through.\n\nChallenge accepted. 💪\n\nFirst things first, we went about fixing the sync issues by building a second\nsystem to replace our unreliable version. Not only was this accomplished, but\nall onboarded merchants were migrated to the new system, with zero downtime. \nRead more about how this was done in this post\n[https://blog.gojekengineering.com/zero-downtime-traffic-migration-at-go-food-17ba413eb8c2]\n.\n\n> One small win.\nNow for the real problems, giving merchants the control they needed over how\nthey were represented on GoFood. The first self-serve feature we introduced to\nGoResto was allowing merchants to update their restaurant status in real time.\n\n> Another small win.\nWe had unlocked a critical component in product design — empathy for the people\nyou’re building for. The question now was — what can we do that will make life\neasier for our merchants?\n\nItem availability? Understood.\nMenu updation? Got it.\nPricing adjustments? Why not.\nAdd categories? Move items between categories? Update images?\n\n> Done, done… and done. ✅\nOur systems were stable, early teething troubles were addressed, we were finally\nsolving the problems that needed solving.\n\nBuild It Right, And They Will Come\nAs GoResto grew in functionality, we began\n\n slowly earning back the goodwill of our merchant community. Soon, our app store\nrating began to reflect that.\n\nApp store ratings reflecting how customer goodwill can be earned back ✌️We\ndidn’t need to push GoResto to merchants anymore, it was adopted due to the ease\nof doing business it offered.\n\n> It was long overdue, but we had accomplished what we had set out to do. There\nwas finally a moment to sit back and enjoy the sunrise.\nOr so we thought.\n\nThe rest was short-lived. Southeast Asia was abuzz with activity. According to\nthis report\n[https://www.blog.google/documents/47/SEA_Internet_Economy_Report_2019.pdf], the\nvalue of the Internet economy in the region tripled in the years since 2015. The\nGross Merchandise Value (GMV) projection for 2025 is estimated to be $300\nbillion.\n\n> To put that in perspective — in 2016, that projection was $100 billion.\nEven as GoResto was being built, there was another behemoth stirring under the\nrich waters of Indonesia’s digital payments landscape. GoPay, which had been\nrapidly growing in this favourable environment since its arrival in 2016, was\nnow being used by roughly three-quarters of digital payments users in Indonesia.\n\nBut we wanted more.\n\nIn 2018, GoPay introduced offline acceptance, bringing a whole new category of\nmerchant partners into our ecosystem.\n\n> Our existing solution wasn’t good enough anymore. It was time to evolve.\nKeep watching this space for the continued story charting GoResto’s evolution\ninto our full-fledged merchants platform — GoBiz.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWant our updates beamed straight to your inbox?

This, in turn, began to reflect on us publicly.</p><p><strong><strong>Our app store rating at this point slid down to 3.2.</strong></strong></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/794/1*tK41Ht4hzRXSuKNR5w2qxA.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><h1 id=\"make-it-work-then-make-it-better\">Make It Work, Then Make It Better</h1><p>We clearly had a long way to go to make GoResto the app our merchants deserved. Things were bad, but as they say — sometimes the only way out is through.</p><p><strong><strong>Challenge accepted. 💪</strong></strong></p><p>First things first, we went about fixing the sync issues by building a second system to replace our unreliable version. Not only was this accomplished, but all onboarded merchants were migrated to the new system, with <em><em>zero downtime. </em></em>Read more about how this was done <a href=\"https://blog.gojekengineering.com/zero-downtime-traffic-migration-at-go-food-17ba413eb8c2\" rel=\"noopener\">in this post</a>.</p><blockquote><em><em>One small win.</em></em></blockquote><p>Now for the real problems, giving merchants the control they needed over how they were represented on GoFood. The first self-serve feature we introduced to GoResto was allowing merchants to update their restaurant status in real time.</p><blockquote><em><em>Another small win.</em></em></blockquote><p>We had unlocked a critical component in product design — empathy for the people you’re building for. The question now was — what can we do that will make life easier for our merchants?</p><p><em><em>Item availability?</em></em> Understood.<br><em><em>Menu updation?</em></em> Got it.<br><em><em>Pricing adjustments?</em></em> Why not.<br><em><em>Add categories? Move items between categories?

Soon, our app store rating began to reflect that.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1864/1*j3tGYn7EvCzlh46jk5cyPw.png\" class=\"kg-image\"><figcaption>App store ratings reflecting how customer goodwill can be earned back ✌️</figcaption></figure><p>We didn’t need to push GoResto to merchants anymore, it was adopted due to the ease of doing business it offered.</p><blockquote><em><em>It was long overdue, but we had accomplished what we had set out to do. There was finally a moment to sit back and enjoy the sunrise.</em></em></blockquote><p>Or so we thought.</p><p>The rest was short-lived. Southeast Asia was abuzz with activity. <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/documents/47/SEA_Internet_Economy_Report_2019.pdf\" rel=\"noopener\">According to this report</a>, the value of the Internet economy in the region tripled in the years since 2015.

Nadiem, Andre and Kevin have been\nrunning the business together for a number of years, which will ensure that this\nleadership transition will run smoothly.\n\nNadiem’s news was communicated in an email to all Gojek staff that was sent\ntoday. In the email, he looked back on how the company has grown over the past\nnine years and also set out his hopes for the future of the business:\n\n“We started this company with nothing, other than a deep desire to change things\nfor the better. We saw that the streets of Jakarta were a mess and that there\nwas an informal community of ojek drivers who could easily act as a huge part of\nthe solution to that mess, if only they were organised and working efficiently.\n\n“With just that initial desire to improve life for everyone, as well as a large\namount of support from countless friends, partners and stakeholders, we’ve\ncreated Gojek. An iconic company that flies the flag for the future of Indonesia\nand Southeast Asia.\n\n“I will leave Gojek in the capable hands of Andre Soelistyo and Kevin Aluwi as\nco-CEOs, both of whom have played central roles in moving the company along its\npath from that office in South Jakarta onto the global stage.\n\n“We got very lucky as we progressed along that path, but I believe that luck in\nbusiness only really becomes a valuable commodity if you have the brilliant\nminds needed to take advantage of it. Kevin and Andre have mentored me to be the\nleader I am today. They are quite simply Gojek’s best. They have been running\nthis company for a number of years and I have complete faith not just in their\ntechnical skills and ability to execute flawlessly, but also in their integrity\nand their desire to do the right thing every step of the way.\n\n“High emotions are involved in running a company like Gojek but Andre and Kevin\nare always the steady voices of reason, approaching problems with intelligence\nand compassion. I couldn’t ask for better successors as the Gojek movement\nbegins its next stage of growth.”\n\nA joint statement released by Andre and Kevin said: “When a friend and mentor\nleaves a business you have built together, there is always going to be some\nsadness, but we are both determined that Gojek will go from strength to\nstrength. We will continue to implement our vision as we focus on what the Gojek\nof the next ten years is going to be like.\n\n“This company has changed the lives of so many people in Indonesia and around\nthe region, and our key priority is to ensure that we can continue to act as a\npositive force in society for the foreseeable future.”\n\nUnder Andre and Kevin’s management, Gojek has grown exponentially, to process\nover two billion transactions a year. The company’s fundraising efforts have\nattracted some of the world’s most exciting companies including Google, Tencent,\nMitsubishi, Visa, AIA and Astra, with Series F set to raise well over US$2bn.\nThe company has also launched operations in Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam,\nwhile the Gojek app has become the most-used on-demand application in Indonesia,\nwhere its food and payments businesses have overtaken transport to become the\nlargest businesses within the group.\n\nWith the new structure, Andre will focus on corporate functions and management\nof capital allocation, international expansion as well as the payments and\nfinancial services businesses, while Kevin will focus on the product development\nelements of the Gojek business as well as marketing, organisational development\nand the transportation and food delivery businesses.\n\nSince co-founding Gojek, Kevin has held significant leadership roles across\nproduct and functional teams within the organisation. He has used his background\nin Business Intelligence to pioneer the use of data for decision-making across\nthe Gojek business. He has also assembled deep technology expertise across the\ndata, engineering and product teams, with a focus on enhancing the platform’s\noverall user experience. Prior to his role at Gojek, Kevin spent time at Zalora\nIndonesia, Merah Putih Incubator and Salem Partners.\n\nSimilarly, Andre has played a pivotal role in laying a solid foundation for\nGojek’s rapid growth. He has overseen over US$4bn of fundraising, which\nattracted key investors such as Google, Tencent, Astra, KKR and Warburg Pincus.\nHe has also laid the foundation for the company’s business strategy for long\nterm sustainability. Prior to joining Gojek, Andre was an Executive Director at\nNorthstar Group — Indonesia’s largest private equity fund, and was previously\nthe Head of Corporate Finance at Delta Dunia Makmur.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLeading the next phase of Gojek — a statement from Gojek Co-CEOs, Kevin Aluwi\nand Andre Soelistyo\nGojek’s new co-CEOs Kevin Aluwi and Andre Soelistyo have today released a\nstatement following the announcement that Founder Nadiem Makarim has accepted a\nposition in President Joko Widodo’s new cabinet.\n\nAndre and Kevin have been running the business along with Nadiem, for a number\nof years, which will ensure a smooth leadership transition.

His achievements have been a source of inspiration to everyone at\nGojek and he leaves the business at a time when there’s never been more\nexcitement about its future potential. We now have over two million driver\npartners across Southeast Asia and over 500,000 merchants, all of whom together\nprocess over two billion transactions annually.\n\n“Both of us have been running the Gojek business alongside Nadiem for some time,\nso there will be no disruption to the day to day operations or the amazing\ngrowth we have enjoyed over the years. Andre will focus on corporate functions\nand management of capital allocation, international expansion as well as\npayments and financial services, while Kevin will focus on the product\ndevelopment elements of the Gojek business as well as marketing, organisational\ndevelopment and the transportation and food delivery businesses.\n\n“We are well prepared for the future and this is due in large part to the many\noutstanding industry leaders that have joined us over the past few years, and\nthe collective vision and execution of the entire Gojek team.\n\n“We would like to conclude by thanking the government of Indonesia for\nrecognising the significance our business has had on society.

Let’s take music as an example. It\nhelps to know the theory and to understand the mechanics of your instrument. It\nalso helps to have talent. Having a good partner to watch your back doesn’t hurt\neither. But there’s more to it.\n\nWhy are The Beatles [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles], who formed in\nLiverpool in 1960, considered one of the greatest bands in history\n[https://www.quora.com/Why-are-The-Beatles-the-greatest-band-in-history/answer/Giliana-P-Garc%C3%ADa-Acevedo-1]\n? Why doesn’t everyone else achieve the same level of success?\n\n> The difference between master and beginner is the amount of practice.\nThe Beatles applied the fundamentals they learned over and over again, using\nfeedback to get better every time. All told, they performed for 270 nights in\njust over a year-and-a-half. By the time they had their first taste of success\nin 1964, they had performed live an estimated 1,200 times. Most bands today\ndon’t perform that much in their entire career.\n\nThe 10,000 Hours rule\nIn the early 1990s, psychologist K. Anders Ericsson and two of his colleagues at\nBerlin’s elite Academy of Music conducted a study\n[http://projects.ict.usc.edu/itw/gel/EricssonDeliberatePracticePR93.PDF]. With\nthe help of the Academy, they interviewed twelve expert pianists (8 men and 4\nwomen) and 12 amateurs (7 men and 5 women).\n\nThe amateurs never practiced more than about three hours a week over the course\nof their childhood, and by the age of twenty, they had totaled two thousand\nhours of practice. The experts, on the other hand, steadily increased their\npractice time every year, until by the age of twenty, they had reached ten\nthousand hours.\n\n> “To become a chess grandmaster also seems to take about ten years. (Only the\nlegendary Bobby Fisher got to that elite level in less than that amount of time:\nit took him nine years.) And what’s ten years? Well, it’s roughly how long it\ntakes to put in ten thousand hours of hard practice. Ten thousand hours is the\nmagic number of greatness.”\n> Malcolm Gladwell, in his book “Outliers: The Story of Success\n[http://amzn.to/wgo1hw]”\nThe interesting thing about that number, of course, is that ten thousand hours\nis an enormous amount of time. It’s all but impossible to reach that number all\nby yourself by the time you’re a young adult. This would require encouraging\nparents and some measure of wealth, which would avoid the need to hold down\nadditional jobs that would eat into valuable practice time.\n\nWhat Happens in the Software Industry\nIn the software industry, we take developers trained in theory and throw them\nstraight into the deep-end, working on a project with no real precedent to draw\nfrom. It’s like taking a group of kids to fight against the big gang in the\ntown. But that is not an issue because, in software engineering, we do our\npracticing on the job, and that’s why we make mistakes on the job. But at the\nend of the day, we want to be great while still managing the objectives. For\nthat purpose, we need to find ways of splitting the practice from the\nprofession. A practice method that is effective and without taking up too much\ntime.\n\n> This is where CodeKata comes in.\nThe CodeKata\nKata [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kata] is an exercise in Karate to execute a\nspecified series of a variety of moves, with stepping and turning, while\nattempting to maintain perfect form. It teaches the student about proper form\nand position to helped them visualize different scenarios for each motion and\ntechnique. Traditionally, kata is taught in stages. Previously learned kata are\nrepeated to show better technique or power as a student acquires knowledge and\nexperience. It is common for students to repeat every kata they have learned but\nat an improved level of quality.\n\nSandy Vs. SpongebobCodeKata is an attempt to bring this element of practice to software\ndevelopment. The intent behind CodeKata is similar to Karate Kata. Each is a\nshort exercise. It repeated multiple times, adding little improvements in each\ncycle. Some involve programming and can be coded in many different ways. Some\ninvolve thinking about the issues behind programming and design. These are\nunlikely to have a single correct answer.\n\n> Remember that the point of the kata is not arriving at the correct answer. The\npoint is the stuff you learn along the way. The goal is the practice, not the\nsolution.\nHow Is This Accomplished at Gojek?\nAt Gojek, there’s a program for employees called Engineering Bootcamp\n[https://blog.gojekengineering.com/what-is-the-go-jek-engineering-bootcamp-de7778836da9]\n. Basically, it is weeks of intense hands-on learning designed to unlearn and\nequip skills needed to be a world-class engineer.\n\nCore Engineering BootcampAt Bootcamp, the way coaches taught us (participants)\nis similar to CodeKata. We have a code drill session in the afternoon to solve\none problem by using Java. After the class ends, we solve the same problem again\nas homework in the evening using Ruby. There are many things we did in our code\ndrill session, that really helped us develop in CodeKata. Those are:\n\n1. Set Rules\nWe have rules called Non-Negotiable Etiquette. If you violate one of the rules,\nyou have to rm -rf your code and start it again from scratch. What is rm -rf? It\nis a basic command on Unix system to remove files or directories from the\nmachine forever.\n\nNon Negotiable Etiquette\nIf you violate one, rm -rf! never love your code </3\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n 1.  Indentation and spacing between code constructs (classes/methods/specs)\n     must be consistent.\n 2.  Use only spaces (no tabs) for indentation.\n 3.  Newlines at end of file.\n 4.  Follow accepted naming conventions for your language/framework.\n 5.  Follow accepted naming file and Directory structure for your\n     language/framework.\n 6.  Use namespaces.\n 7.  No comments/Unused Code/Unused file/Unused folder must ever be checked in.\n 8.  Runtime environment should be consistent with IDE environment -  i.e there\n     should be no difference in running a build or a spec from your IDE and from\n     the command line.\n 9.  Use .gitignore.\n 10. Ensure there is a README.md that includes problem description, dev\n     environment setup, build instructions, and run instructions.\n 11. Test Driven Development (this should show in clear pattern in the commit\n     log - one spec, one code change per commit)\n\nCan you imagine the feeling when code that we wrote with blood and tears needs\nto be deleted for one small mistake? Is that acceptable?\n\n> Yes, you must not love your code.\nThat small mistake is not tolerable in production and even development. It could\ncause bugs, errors or other things that may become a bottleneck. But of course,\nwe don’t rm -rf in work 😂. It’s just a practice so that we don’t get overly\nattached to the code, remain careful about mistakes, and most importantly —\nmaintain quality.\n\n2. Practise Pair Programming\nAs the name implies, pair programming is where two developers work on one\nmachine. We only have a keyboard and a mouse for each pair. One developer acts\nas the driver who codes while the other serves as the observer who checks the\ncode being written, proofreads and spell-checks, and also figures out where to\ngo next. These roles can be switched at any time: the driver will then become\nthe observer and vice versa.\n\nPair Programming greatly helps us in CodeKata, because:\n\n * It’s harder to procrastinate. Working as a team means you can’t stop and\n   check your email, Slack, Facebook or WhatsApp every few minutes.\n * When someone shares a problem you are going through, you feel less defeated\n   and more positive about trying again.\n * Increases software quality without impacting much on time to deliver. It will\n   cost only 15% of the development time according to this study\n   [https://www.economist.com/technology-quarterly/2001/09/20/agility-counts].\n   But with increased quality comes big savings later in the project.\n\n3. Have a Short Cycle\nThe point of CodeKata is to get experience from practice. In order to achieve\nthat, we solve the same problem multiple times. We try different approaches and\nsolutions to experience each advantage and disadvantage. While we work on it, we\nalso try to add little improvements for every cycle. But sometimes, we can also\ntreat the cycle as an iteration of solving the problem.\n\nBecause CodeKata is a practicing method and not project development. It’s not\nsupposed to be worked on for the long run. For that reason, we only have 20–30\nmins for every cycle (sometimes even shorter).\n\nAfter the Mini Retro, we showcase our code to other participants in the class.\nWhy do we need to do it? Even though the whole class is working on the same\nproblem, we may interpret it differently and have hundreds of possible different\nsolutions. Doing a showcase will tell others about progress and approaches. It\nwill trigger a discussion and synchronize the context for everyone. At the end\nof the day, we will converge at the current best solution.\n\n> It’s similar to Agile Development. You deliver something to the customer as soon\nas possible to get feedback faster.\nA Few Final Thoughts\nMy tips for CodeKata are:\n\n * Find a place and time where you won’t be interrupted.\n * Focus on the essential elements of the Kata.\n * Remember to look for feedback for every major decision\n * If it helps, keep a journal of your progress\n * Have discussion groups with other developers, but try to have completed the\n   kata first\n\nCore Engineering BootcampThank you for reading this blog!

Well, it’s roughly how long it takes to put in ten thousand hours of hard practice. <strong><strong>Ten thousand hours</strong></strong> is the magic number of greatness.”</em></em></blockquote><blockquote><em><em>Malcolm Gladwell, in his book “<a href=\"http://amzn.to/wgo1hw\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Outliers: The Story of Success</em></a><em>”</em></em></em></blockquote><p>The interesting thing about that number, of course, is that ten thousand hours is an enormous amount of time. It’s all but impossible to reach that number all by yourself by the time you’re a young adult. This would require encouraging parents and some measure of wealth, which would avoid the need to hold down additional jobs that would eat into valuable practice time.</p><h3 id=\"what-happens-in-the-software-industry\">What Happens in the Software Industry</h3><p>In the software industry, we take developers trained in theory and throw them straight into the deep-end, working on a project with no real precedent to draw from. It’s like taking a group of kids to fight against the big gang in the town. But that is not an issue because, in software engineering, we do our practicing on the job, and that’s why we make mistakes on the job. But at the end of the day, we want to be great while still managing the objectives. For that purpose, we need to find ways of splitting the practice from the profession. A practice method that is effective and without taking up too much time.</p><blockquote><em><em>This is where CodeKata comes in.</em></em></blockquote><h3 id=\"the-codekata\">The CodeKata</h3><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kata\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong><strong>Kata</strong></strong></a> is an exercise in Karate to execute a specified series of a variety of moves, with stepping and turning, while attempting to maintain perfect form. It teaches the student about proper form and position to helped them visualize different scenarios for each motion and technique. Traditionally, kata is taught in stages. Previously learned kata are repeated to show better technique or power as a student acquires knowledge and experience. It is common for students to repeat every kata they have learned but at an improved level of quality.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/670/1*icPku4JdhwTHMvyV7uPLZw.gif\" class=\"kg-image\"><figcaption>Sandy Vs. Spongebob</figcaption></figure><p><strong><strong>CodeKata</strong></strong> is an attempt to bring this element of practice to software development. The intent behind CodeKata is similar to Karate Kata. Each is a short exercise. It repeated multiple times, adding little improvements in each cycle. Some involve programming and can be coded in many different ways. Some involve thinking about the issues behind programming and design. These are unlikely to have a single correct answer.</p><blockquote>Remember that the point of the kata is not arriving at the correct answer. The point is the stuff you learn along the way. The goal is the practice, not the solution.</blockquote><h3 id=\"how-is-this-accomplished-at-gojek\">How Is This Accomplished at Gojek?</h3><p>At Gojek, there’s a program for employees called <a href=\"https://blog.gojekengineering.com/what-is-the-go-jek-engineering-bootcamp-de7778836da9\" rel=\"noopener\">Engineering Bootcamp</a>. Basically, it is weeks of intense hands-on learning designed to unlearn and equip skills needed to be a world-class engineer.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/3840/1*uo6NJ-s_43bjcY2V_JDSPQ.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\"><figcaption>Core Engineering Bootcamp</figcaption></figure><p>At Bootcamp, the way coaches taught us (participants) is similar to CodeKata. We have a code drill session in the afternoon to solve one problem by using Java. After the class ends, we solve the same problem again as homework in the evening using Ruby. There are many things we did in our code drill session, that really helped us develop in CodeKata. Those are:</p><h3 id=\"1-set-rules\">1. Set Rules</h3><p>We have rules called <strong><strong>Non-Negotiable Etiquette</strong></strong>. If you violate one of the rules, you have to <em><em>rm -rf</em></em> your code and start it again from scratch. What is <em><em>rm -rf</em></em>? It is a basic command on Unix system to remove files or directories from the machine forever.</p><h3 id=\"non-negotiable-etiquette\">Non Negotiable Etiquette</h3><p>If you violate one, rm -rf! never love your code &lt;/3</p><hr><ol><li>Indentation and spacing between code constructs (classes/methods/specs) must be consistent.</li><li>Use only spaces (no tabs) for indentation.</li><li>Newlines at end of file.</li><li>Follow accepted naming conventions for your language/framework.</li><li>Follow accepted naming file and Directory structure for your language/framework.</li><li>Use namespaces.</li><li>No comments/Unused Code/Unused file/Unused folder must ever be checked in.</li><li>Runtime environment should be consistent with IDE environment -  i.e there should be no difference in running a build or a spec from your IDE and from the command line.</li><li>Use .gitignore.</li><li>Ensure there is a README.md that includes problem description, dev environment setup, build instructions, and run instructions.</li><li>Test Driven Development (this should show in clear pattern in the commit log - one spec, one code change per commit)</li></ol><p>Can you imagine the feeling when code that we wrote with blood and tears needs to be deleted for one small mistake? Is that acceptable?</p><blockquote>Yes, you must not love your code.</blockquote><p>That small mistake is not tolerable in production and even development. It could cause bugs, errors or other things that may become a bottleneck. But of course, we don’t <em><em>rm -rf</em></em> in work 😂. It’s just a practice so that we don’t get overly attached to the code, remain careful about mistakes, and most importantly — maintain quality.</p><h3 id=\"2-practise-pair-programming\">2. Practise Pair Programming</h3><p>As the name implies, pair programming is where two developers work on one machine. We only have a keyboard and a mouse for each pair. One developer acts as the driver who codes while the other serves as the observer who checks the code being written, proofreads and spell-checks, and also figures out where to go next. These roles can be switched at any time: the driver will then become the observer and vice versa.</p><p>Pair Programming greatly helps us in CodeKata, because:</p><ul><li>It’s harder to procrastinate. Working as a team means you can’t stop and check your email, Slack, Facebook or WhatsApp every few minutes.</li><li>When someone shares a problem you are going through, you feel less defeated and more positive about trying again.</li><li>Increases software quality without impacting much on time to deliver. It will cost only 15% of the development time according to this <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/technology-quarterly/2001/09/20/agility-counts\" rel=\"noopener\">study</a>. But with increased quality comes big savings later in the project.</li></ul><h3 id=\"3-have-a-short-cycle\">3. Have a Short Cycle</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/982/1*14PeUCfZheM8mK7xm6FL8w.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>The point of CodeKata is to get experience from practice. In order to achieve that, we solve the same problem multiple times. We try different approaches and solutions to experience each advantage and disadvantage. While we work on it, we also try to add little improvements for every cycle. But sometimes, we can also treat the cycle as an iteration of solving the problem.</p><p>Because CodeKata is a practicing method and not project development. It’s not supposed to be worked on for the long run. For that reason, we only have 20–30 mins for every cycle (sometimes even shorter).</p><p>After the Mini Retro, we showcase our code to other participants in the class. Why do we need to do it? Even though the whole class is working on the same problem, we may interpret it differently and have hundreds of possible different solutions. Doing a showcase will tell others about progress and approaches. It will trigger a discussion and synchronize the context for everyone. At the end of the day, we will converge at the current best solution.</p><blockquote>It’s similar to Agile Development. You deliver something to the customer as soon as possible to get feedback faster.</blockquote><h3 id=\"a-few-final-thoughts\">A Few Final Thoughts</h3><p>My tips for CodeKata are:</p><ul><li>Find a place and time where you won’t be interrupted.</li><li>Focus on the essential elements of the Kata.</li><li>Remember to look for feedback for every major decision</li><li>If it helps, keep a journal of your progress</li><li>Have discussion groups with other developers, but try to have completed the kata first</li></ul><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/4240/1*53r0Npq_Thb0R0saRF08Rg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\"><figcaption>Core Engineering Bootcamp</figcaption></figure><p>Thank you for reading this blog!

They help us validate our hypotheses without\nhaving to involve our entire user base. However, any good experiment first\nrequires the answer to the question — how do we know the right number of people\nto include in it?\n\nLet’s break down why this is important. If we target too few, our experiments\nwill not detect smaller effects, leading us to miss legitimate opportunities. If\nwe target too many, we would be wasting resources and potentially hurting our\nbusiness metrics (if the treatments turn out to be detrimental).\n\nPreviously, we used simple heuristics (and a mysterious formula) to estimate the\nrequired sample size. These practices were not very scientific and produced\ninconsistent experimental results. To compensate, we had to repeat the same\nexperiment multiple times just to validate the results. Sometimes different\niterations would conflict with each other, leaving everyone scratching their\nheads.\n\nLast year, we ditched those unscientific practices and built a new tool called\nSample Size Calculator (yes, imaginative name, we know). This post explains how\nthe calculator helps us find the right number of people to include in\nexperiments.\n\nOur calculator is based on Frequentist school of statistics. Under the hood, we\nused both the pwr\n[https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pwr/vignettes/pwr-vignette.html] \npackage and the base sample size calculation functions in R programming\nlanguage. This is what the tool looks like:\n\nFigure 1. Screenshot of the Sample Size Calculator used at GojekThe most\nimportant parameters are the type of dependent variable measured, the historical\ndata, and the required sensitivity from the experiment. As you can see in the\ngraph, if we increase sensitivity to allow detection of smaller effects, the\nrequired sample size soars, which makes sense.\n\nAlthough this is a major step in the right direction, there is a problem if we\nare interested in a continuous dependent variable for our experiment. This is\nbecause the underlying methodology used in the calculator assumes a normal\ndistribution, while most continuous metrics that we care about at Gojek — such\nas bookings per user — are usually skewed. By ‘skewed’, we mean that most users\nare light users and only a small percentage are heavy users. This could cause\nthe computed sample size requirement to be wrong because a key assumption was\nnot met.\n\nWe have four options to deal with this problem:\n\n 1. Use a methodology that doesn’t assume normality. Unfortunately, the\n    available non-parametric methods are complex to implement [1\n    [http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~ejohnson/regression/Sample%20Size%20Power%20Considerations.pdf]\n    ] [2 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4423589/]]\n 2. Transform data to have a normal distribution. This doesn’t always work —\n    some data just can’t be coerced to normal\n 3. Use a larger sample size. Since the worry is lower power than expected,\n    simple multiplication should boost the power, but the multiplier needs to be\n    reasonable. Figuring the right multiplier would be another beast on its own\n 4. Ignore it. This is the path we took\n\n> But but but… that’s not scientific!\nDon’t worry. We tested the robustness of this solution before going ahead with\nit.\n\nAs you can see in the graph below, we created two right-skewed distributions\nwith known 5% difference in means to serve as our populations. The plan is to\ncontinuously sample from this population (equivalent to replicating the same\nexperiment many times) and see how often we can detect this 5% difference (aka\nwhat is our “power [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_(statistics)]”).\n\nFigure 2. Two right-skewed distributions (typical shape for continuous metric at\nGojek) with known mean difference (lift) of 5%The first step is to calculate the\nrequired sample size with a power of 80% and minimum detectable effect of 5%.\nLet’s refer to this sample size requirement as the “exact” size. Then we divide\nand multiply it by three and call them “less” and “more”, respectively. For each\nsample size, we sample from the populations, compute the mean difference\n(typically called “lift”), and repeat this procedure many times.\n\nThe resulting distributions of lifts are shown below. The coloured vertical\nlines show the average lift of each experimental size, which is also equal to\nthe actual population lift. This is central limit theorem\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem] at work. What is\ninteresting are the relative shapes of the sampling distributions. The “more”\ngroup is the safest and most consistent but the “exact” group seems to have good\naccuracy with only a third of the sample size. In the “less” group, we even see\na non-negligible number of lifts that are negative, even though we know the\npopulation lift is actually +5%. This is in line with our intuition that larger\nsample size is generally more trustworthy than a smaller one, all else being\nequal.\n\nFigure 3. Sampling distribution of the mean difference from each size groupSince\nwe currently report the statistical significance of our experimental results at\nGojek, we will also run t-test for each of our sample here.\n\nAs it turns out, 80.4% of the experiments in the “exact” group have\nstatistically significant results (p < 0.05), which is almost equal to the 80%\npower we set in the sample size calculator. In layman’s terms, the tool roughly\npromised that if you run the experiment with this sample size, you have 80%\nchance of detecting a 5% lift (the minimum detectable effect) if it’s there.\n\nSince it kept its promise even on non-normally distributed data, we can conclude\nthat the methodology is robust to some degree of violation of the normality\nassumption. Therefore we can ignore it until otherwise proven.\n\nFigure 4. Percentage of samples/experiments with statistically significant\nresults (p < 0.05) from each size groupMeanwhile, the “less” group had only ~34%\nstatistically significant results, suggesting that we shouldn’t run an\nexperiment if we cannot fulfil the sample size requirement — since we risk not\nbeing able to detect an existing effect. With the “more” group having close to\n100% statistically significant results, we again reaffirm that larger sample\nsize is generally a good thing if we can afford it.\n\nSince it was deployed in mid-2018, many teams across Gojek have adopted the\nSample Size Calculator. So far, nearly 1,000 experiments have incorporated this\ntool in their designs, and it is also a part of Litmus, our experimentation\nplatform\n[https://blog.gojekengineering.com/introducing-litmus-gojeks-own-experimentation-platform-3803467b6a53]\n. The more critical takeaway for us is that the experiments run using the\nrecommended sample sizes have similar results when full-scaled. This fact has\nenabled us to iterate faster and cut waste while maintaining a high degree of\nconfidence in the experimental results. ✌️\n\nDid we mention Gojek’s Growth team is hiring analysts?

At Gojek, we handle more than 3 million\norders a day across our 20+ products.\n\nAs you can imagine, the number of push notifications we send are proportionally\nlarge — about a million every hour to be exact.This post describes the\nchallenges we faced while working with such high notification volumes, and the\nsolutions we developed to solve them.\n\nVolume is only one part of the problem, many additional challenges were somewhat\nunique to Gojek:\n\n1. Multiple applications\nGojek isn’t comprised of just a single app. In addition to the Gojek app for\ncustomers, we also have GoLife, as well as our driver apps, merchant apps, and\nservice provider apps for GoLife.\n\nWhen one of our systems wants to send a notification, it could be for a specific\napplication of a user (for example, we don’t want to send GoLife booking\nnotifications to the Gojek app), or for all applications (for example, a\npromotional notification).\n\nOur system needed to be flexible enough to choose between an option to broadcast\nthe notification to all applications, or to a specific application.\n\n2. Multiple notification providers\nSince we support both iOS and Android for our customer applications, we needed\nto support multiple notification systems.\n\nFor Android devices, we have FCM (Firebase Cloud Messaging) and the deprecated\nGCM (Google Cloud Messaging) API. For iOS, we have APNS (Apple Push Notification\nservice).\n\nEach notification provider has different API keys and tokens for different\napplication IDs. For example, the FCM API key would be different for GoLife as\nopposed to Gojek.\n\n3. Multiple devices per user\nWe allow our users to stay signed in to multiple devices at a time. For us, this\nalso means that any push notification sent to the user must be sent to all of\nthe devices that the user is currently logged into.\n\nThis is also a combination of the previous two problems:\n\n 1. The user can be logged into multiple applications on a single device (Gojek\n    + GoLife)\n 2. The user may be logged into different devices, where each device requires a\n    different push notification provider. For example, a user can be logged into\n    Gojek on their Android, as well as iOS device.\n\n4. Multiple services that want to send notifications\nGojek uses a micro-service architecture, where the services of each of our\nproducts need to send notifications to our users.\n\nWe want to make it as easy as possible for any service to be able to send a\nnotification, without worrying about the multiple devices and providers that we\ndiscussed.\n\nPush notification service architecture\n\nIn order to address the above challenges, and make sure that the API remains as\nsimple as possible, we built our notification system as three components:\n\n 1. Notification server — exposes the API to send notifications, and pushes it\n    as a job on our job queue\n 2. Token store — stores the devices and devices tokens of all the currently\n    logged-in users\n 3. Notification worker — consumes jobs on the job queue and sends notifications\n    via the notification providers.\n\nEach component abstracts away some part of the problems we discussed above.\nLet’s take a look at each part in more detail:\n\n1. Token store\nOnce a user is logged into our application, the application makes a call to the\ntoken store API with their device token and application ID.\n\n\nThis entry is then removed when the user logs out.\n\n> The token store abstracts the process of deciding which devices to send a\nnotification to for each user\n2. Notification server\nThis is an HTTP server that exposes an API internally to send notifications.\n\nIn order to make things simple, the API accepts the user ID, and an optional\napplication ID as HTTP headers, and notification information in the request\nbody:\n\nPOST http://<base_url>/notification\nuser_id: <user_id>\napplication_id: <application_id>\n\n{\n\"payload\": {},\n\"title\": \"You driver is here\",\n\"message\": \"Please meet your driver at the pickup point\"\n}\n\nThe server fetches all of the users devices from the token store, and schedules\na job for each of the users devices.\n\n> The notification server abstracts the external interface to the system. Now,\nother services in Gojek that need to send out a notification just need to call\nour API with the user ID, and the system takes care of the rest\n3. Job Queue\nWe use RabbitMQ as an exchange for our job queues. We have a queue for each\napplication ID and provider type.\n\n\nThis is important because we want to isolate failures for each application and\nprovider type. For example, if our FCM token expires for com.gojek.app, we don't\nwant to stall the jobs for com.gojek.life or com.gojek.driver.bike.\n\n4. Notification workers\n\nThe worker processes consume messages from the job queues, and send out messages\nto the respective notification providers.\n\nIn order to make our code simpler, and to accommodate different service\nproviders if needed, we make use of interfaces to abstract the functionality\nimplemented by each provider:\n\ntype PushService interface {\nPush(ctx context.Context, m PushRequest) (PushResponse, error)\n}\n\nThe Push method takes a request object and returns a response object.\n\nThe request structure contains information related to the recipient and\nadditional options about the notification, like expiry time, title and text:\n\ntype PushRequest struct {\nDeviceID   string \nTitle      string\nMessage    string\nPayload    map[string]interface{}\n//some other parameters omitted\n}\n\nThe response contains information on whether the notification was sent to the\nprovider’s server successfully:\n\ntype PushResponse struct {\nSuccess         bool\nErrorMsg        string\n}\nWe then implement the interface for specific providers. For example, the code\nfor Google FCM provider, and Apples APNS provider looks something like this:\n\ntype FCMProvider struct {\n// configuration for our provider, like API token and URL endpoint\n}func (p *FCMProvider) Push(ctx context.Context, m queue.Message)\n(notification.PushResponse, error) {\n// code to send a notification payload to FCMs server\n}type APNSProvider struct {\n// configuration for our provider, like API token and URL endpoint\n}func (p *APNSProvider) Push(ctx context.Context, m queue.Message)\n(notification.PushResponse, error) {\n// code to send a notification payload to FCMs server\n}\n\n> The notification worker abstracts the process of selecting the correct provider\nto send the notification. It selects the correct provider, with the correct API\nkey based on the application ID of the message received from the queue.\nConclusion\nBy finding common patterns in the challenges we faced, and abstracting them into\ntheir own services, we turned a relatively complex problem into a suite of\nservices that are reasonably straightforward and easy to manage on their own.\n\nEach time we found a point which needed to handle multiple implementations of\nthe same core logic, we put it behind a dedicated service:\n\n 1. Multiple devices for a user was put behind the token service\n 2. Multiple applications were given a common interface on notification server\n 3. Multiple providers were handled by individual job queues and notification\n    workers\n\nIn the end, we wound up with a system that can comfortably handle over a million\nnotifications every hour.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWant more updates on how we build scalable systems for Southeast Asia’s\n#SuperApp?

Multiple applications</h1><p>Gojek isn’t comprised of just a single app. In addition to the Gojek app for customers, we also have GoLife, as well as our driver apps, merchant apps, and service provider apps for GoLife.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/882/1*LydaxXs7dKWE8OvGt7Opnw.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>When one of our systems wants to send a notification, it could be for a specific application of a user (for example, we don’t want to send GoLife booking notifications to the Gojek app), or for all applications (for example, a promotional notification).</p><p>Our system needed to be flexible enough to choose between an option to broadcast the notification to all applications, or to a specific application.</p><h1 id=\"2-multiple-notification-providers\">2. Multiple notification providers</h1><p>Since we support both iOS and Android for our customer applications, we needed to support multiple notification systems.</p><p>For Android devices, we have FCM (Firebase Cloud Messaging) and the deprecated GCM (Google Cloud Messaging) API. For iOS, we have APNS (Apple Push Notification service).</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/962/1*gx05-ArzDJLasMbmiOmiqA.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>Each notification provider has different API keys and tokens for different application IDs. For example, the FCM API key would be different for GoLife as opposed to Gojek.</p><h1 id=\"3-multiple-devices-per-user\">3. Multiple devices per user</h1><p>We allow our users to stay signed in to multiple devices at a time. For us, this also means that any push notification sent to the user must be sent to all of the devices that the user is currently logged into.</p><p>This is also a combination of the previous two problems:</p><ol><li>The user can be logged into multiple applications on a single device (Gojek + GoLife)</li><li>The user may be logged into different devices, where each device requires a different push notification provider. For example, a user can be logged into Gojek on their Android, as well as iOS device.</li></ol><h1 id=\"4-multiple-services-that-want-to-send-notifications\">4. Multiple services that want to send notifications</h1><p>Gojek uses a micro-service architecture, where the services of each of our products need to send notifications to our users.</p><p>We want to make it as easy as possible for any service to be able to send a notification, without worrying about the multiple devices and providers that we discussed.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/501/1*6IaF4_PwdHWk6RowO0OnoA.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>Push notification service architecture</p><p>In order to address the above challenges, and make sure that the API remains as simple as possible, we built our notification system as three components:</p><ol><li><strong><strong>Notification server</strong></strong> — exposes the API to send notifications, and pushes it as a job on our job queue</li><li><strong><strong>Token store</strong></strong> — stores the devices and devices tokens of all the currently logged-in users</li><li><strong><strong>Notification worker</strong></strong> — consumes jobs on the job queue and sends notifications via the notification providers.</li></ol><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1902/1*2Nmx4MeYAXgekpr3uD8dng.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>Each component abstracts away some part of the problems we discussed above. Let’s take a look at each part in more detail:</p><h2 id=\"1-token-store\">1. Token store</h2><p>Once a user is logged into our application, the application makes a call to the token store API with their device token and application ID.<br></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/2014/1*UoYZSCamWMlz5DcK7fJ9zQ.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>This entry is then removed when the user logs out.</p><blockquote><em><em>The token store abstracts the process of deciding which devices to send a notification to for each user</em></em></blockquote><h2 id=\"2-notification-server\">2. Notification server</h2><p>This is an HTTP server that exposes an API internally to send notifications.</p><p>In order to make things simple, the API accepts the user ID, and an optional application ID as HTTP headers, and notification information in the request body:</p><p><code>POST http://&lt;base_url&gt;/notification<br>user_id: &lt;user_id&gt;<br>application_id: &lt;application_id&gt;</code></p><p><code>{<br>\t\"payload\": {},<br>\t\"title\": \"You driver is here\",<br>\t\"message\": \"Please meet your driver at the pickup point\"<br>}</code></p><p>The server fetches all of the users devices from the token store, and schedules a job for each of the users devices.</p><blockquote><em><em>The notification server abstracts the external interface to the system. Now, other services in Gojek that need to send out a notification just need to call our API with the user ID, and the system takes care of the rest</em></em></blockquote><h2 id=\"3-job-queue\">3. Job Queue</h2><p>We use RabbitMQ as an exchange for our job queues. We have a queue for each application ID and provider type.<br></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1832/1*Mg8xAvNt3o_6W7syBRst-w.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>This is important because we want to isolate failures for each application and provider type. For example, if our FCM token expires for <code>com.gojek.app</code>, we don't want to stall the jobs for <code>com.gojek.life</code> or <code>com.gojek.driver.bike</code>.</p><p>4. Notification workers</p><p>The worker processes consume messages from the job queues, and send out messages to the respective notification providers.</p><p>In order to make our code simpler, and to accommodate different service providers if needed, we make use of interfaces to abstract the functionality implemented by each provider:</p><p><code>type PushService interface {<br>\tPush(ctx context.Context, m PushRequest) (PushResponse, error)<br>}</code></p><p>The <code>Push</code> method takes a request object and returns a response object.</p><p>The request structure contains information related to the recipient and additional options about the notification, like expiry time, title and text:</p><p><code>type PushRequest struct {<br>\tDeviceID   string <br>\tTitle      string<br>\tMessage    string<br>\tPayload    map[string]interface{}<br><em><em>//some other parameters omitted</em></em><br>}</code></p><p>The response contains information on whether the notification was sent to the provider’s server successfully:</p><p><code>type PushResponse struct {<br>\tSuccess         bool<br>\tErrorMsg        string<br>}</code><br>We then implement the interface for specific providers. For example, the code for Google FCM provider, and Apples APNS provider looks something like this:</p><p><code>type FCMProvider struct {<br>\t<em><em>// configuration for our provider, like API token and URL endpoint</em></em><br>}func (p *FCMProvider) Push(ctx context.Context, m queue.Message) (notification.PushResponse, error) {<br>\t<em><em>// code to send a notification payload to FCMs server</em></em><br>}type APNSProvider struct {<br>\t<em><em>// configuration for our provider, like API token and URL endpoint</em></em><br>}func (p *APNSProvider) Push(ctx context.Context, m queue.Message) (notification.PushResponse, error) {<br>\t<em><em>// code to send a notification payload to FCMs server</em></em><br>}</code></p><blockquote><em><em>The notification worker abstracts the process of selecting the correct provider to send the notification. It selects the correct provider, with the correct API key based on the application ID of the message received from the queue.</em></em></blockquote><h1 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h1><p>By finding common patterns in the challenges we faced, and abstracting them into their own services, we turned a relatively complex problem into a suite of services that are reasonably straightforward and easy to manage on their own.</p><p>Each time we found a point which needed to handle multiple implementations of the same core logic, we put it behind a dedicated service:</p><ol><li>Multiple devices for a user was put behind the token service</li><li>Multiple applications were given a common interface on notification server</li><li>Multiple providers were handled by individual job queues and notification workers</li></ol><p>In the end, we wound up with a system that can comfortably handle <strong><strong>over a million notifications every hour</strong></strong>.</p><hr><p>Want more updates on how we build scalable systems for Southeast Asia’s #SuperApp? <a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/go-jek/gojek-tech-newsletter\" rel=\"noopener\">Sign up for our newsletter!</a></p>","url":"https://gojek-ghost.zysk.in/how-we-manage-a-million-push-notifications-an-hour/","canonical_url":null,"uuid":"b9ad7304-57c6-4ff7-9a4e-6424cb767b77","page":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_styles":null,"comment_id":"5ec2af987aa22c4066f83ac4","reading_time":5}},{"node":{"id":"Ghost__Post__5ec2ab927aa22c4066f83a71","title":"Gojek featured in Fortune’s 2019 ‘Change the World’ list","slug":"gojek-featured-in-fortunes-2019-change-the-world-list","featured":false,"feature_image":"https://gojek-ghost.zysk.in/content/images/2020/05/1_hxz1egdrKc2PKoLvno595g.jpeg","excerpt":"GoPay recognised for the acceleration of financial inclusion in Indonesia.","custom_excerpt":"GoPay recognised for the acceleration of financial inclusion in Indonesia.","visibility":"public","created_at_pretty":"18 May, 2020","published_at_pretty":"23 August, 2019","updated_at_pretty":"18 May, 2020","created_at":"2020-05-18T21:06:50.000+05:30","published_at":"2019-08-23T09:30:00.000+05:30","updated_at":"2020-05-18T21:15:28.000+05:30","meta_title":null,"meta_description":"GoPay recognised for the acceleration of financial inclusion in Indonesia.","og_description":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"authors":[{"name":"Gojek","slug":"gojek","bio":"Gojek is a Super App. It’s one app for ordering food, commuting, digital payments, shopping, hyper-local delivery, and two dozen services.","profile_image":"https://gojek-ghost.zysk.in/content/images/2020/05/logo-01-1.png","twitter":"@gojektech","facebook":"gojektech","website":"https://www.gojek.io"}],"primary_author":{"name":"Gojek","slug":"gojek","bio":"Gojek is a Super App. It’s one app for ordering food, commuting, digital payments, shopping, hyper-local delivery, and two dozen services.","profile_image":"https://gojek-ghost.zysk.in/content/images/2020/05/logo-01-1.png","twitter":"@gojektech","facebook":"gojektech","website":"https://www.gojek.io"},"primary_tag":{"name":"News","slug":"news","description":"The latest official updates from Gojek—announcements, press releases, and news stories.","feature_image":null,"meta_description":null,"meta_title":null,"visibility":"public"},"tags":[{"name":"News","slug":"news","description":"The latest official updates from Gojek—announcements, press releases, and news stories.","feature_image":null,"meta_description":null,"meta_title":null,"visibility":"public"}],"plaintext":"By Apoorva Babu\n\nGojek, Southeast Asia’s leading on-demand technology platform, once again made\nit to the annual Fortune ‘Change the World’ list\n[https://fortune.com/change-the-world/2019].

Part\ntwo, which chronicles the journey of GOJEK’s Vietnam launch under the GO-VIET\nbrand, is here [http://bit.ly/2Rm2cSC].\n\nOn to part three then:\n\nPart 3/3 | Accomplishment\nThe atmosphere in Vietnam was celebratory. The GO-VIET launch had gone better\nthan anticipated, and our attempt to build robust, scalable systems looked to\nhave paid off. Ride and Send services were live in Vietnam, and engineers from\nGO-FOOD had already started working with Trifecta — the team spearheading\nGOJEK’s international moves — to launch our food product in Vietnam (FYI, it’s\nlive now).\n\nIn the months following Vietnam launch, Trifecta focused on setting up cadences\nwith different GOJEK product teams to streamline development and release cycles\nfor GO-VIET. Everything was up and running.\n\nNow, for the next stage — Thailand.\n\nThe launch plan for Thailand was similar to what had been executed in Vietnam,\nincluding the products made available at launch (Ride and Send). In Thailand,\nthe brand would launch under the name GET.\n\n> We had proven it could be done. Now it was time to do it again. Easy, right?\nAs would soon become apparent, not really. This ride had a few last twists left.\n\nA Different Method\nWhile our Thailand operation would be similar to Vietnam on the infrastructure\nfront, to say we could just replicate the model as is would be an\noversimplification. For starters, Thailand’s currency, the Thai Baht, was not a\ndepreciated currency like Indonesian Rupiah or Vietnamese Dong.\n\n> Here’s some context:\n> 1 Indonesian Rupiah (IDR) = 0.0049 INR\n1 Vietnamese Dong (VND) = 0.0030 INR\n1 Thai Baht (THB) = 2.2 INR\nIncorporating this change would require some additional work from the team. On\ntop of this, the ride sharing market in Thailand is regulated by the Thai\ngovernment. Existing bike taxis (locally called WIN taxis) are licensed by the\ngovernment to serve as an effective mode of transportation. GOJEK’s entry into\nthe market provided an opportunity for WIN drivers to leverage the online\nplatform, while giving customers easy access to transportation\n\nThis arrangement required some work as well, as existing WIN drivers onboarded\nto GET would need to be prioritised initially while our own onboarding and\ntraining happened in parallel. All this meant that the launch model needed some\ntweaking, but nothing the team would need to sweat over too much.\n\nTalks were completed, local business teams were built, and a deadline was agreed\nupon with the Thai government to launch GET.\n\n> We should have known; rarely do companies building, scaling, and expanding at\nGOJEK’s pace experience such smooth sailing.\nThe Singapore Swing\nWorks, meet spanner.\n\nDue to the seismic shift in the ride-sharing business landscape of Southeast\nAsia in early 2018, GOJEK was also prepping for launch in Singapore on an\naccelerated timeline. Now was a good time to enter the lucrative market — the\nmost developed in the region. GOJEK already enjoyed brand recognition thanks to\nthe amount of business travel between Jakarta and Singapore. By May 2018, a few\nmonths before GO-VIET went live, the launch teams for Singapore had already been\nformed.\n\n> Keeping with Singapore’s iconic lion motif, we named these teams Simba and\nMufasa. Stay tuned to this blog for their story, coming soon. 🦁\nAs 2018 drew on and all teams worked to hit their deadlines, the situation felt\na lot like the storms GOJEK weathered in its infancy. Multiple teams were\ndependent on the same resources as we lined up back-to-back country launches. To\ntop it all, holiday season — one of the busiest times of the year — was also\nkicking off.\n\nvia GIPHY [https://giphy.com/gifs/2oj7STwCx7wAM]\n\nWhile Trifecta had built much of the infrastructure framework required for\nlaunch, there were still dependencies on key GOJEK teams that were currently\nbuilding for Singapore. This threatened to slow down what was an otherwise\nstraightforward development timeline.\n\nThere was also that commitment of a launch date to the Thai Government to think\nabout. The stakes were not trivial.\n\n> The team could not afford to lose more time. Time for desperate measures.\nWith just about a month left for launch, the team members — distributed across\nmultiple locations — convened at the GOJEK Bangalore office. All the\ndocumentation done during the pre-Vietnam launch phase meant that everyone had a\nfair idea of what needed to be done. Launching Singapore and Thailand without\ndelay was critical to business, and we could not afford delays.\n\nWith this in mind, tough decisions were made. The Trifecta team decided to roll\nup their sleeves and take full ownership of Thailand, freeing up the GOJEK\nTransport team to dedicate more resources to Singapore. Trifecta team members\nflew in to Thailand to coordinate the work there, and the project slowly picked\nup steam once again. All the legwork done at the beginning of this exercise had\ncome to fruition.\n\nThe team now had enough context about GOJEK services, and as the days to launch\nticked away, so did the items on the pre-launch checklist.\n\nIt took some doing, with the environment and frameworks built and stabilised\nwhile activities like driver onboarding and early alpha testing happened in\nparallel.\n\n> The going was not easy, but this wasn’t our first rodeo.\nTrifecta Tech Lead Sumit Gupta, who was around in early 2016 during GOJEK’s\nfrantic growth as well, mentions how everyone was more confident this time\naround. Thanks to to the team deciding to build a fast and scalable\ncontainer-based architecture for Vietnam and Thailand, they were sure the system\nwould function reliably. 💪\n\nThe home stretch\nDespite the apprehensions, Trifecta managed to pull through. What had been a\nsystem unfit for launch just a few weeks before the stipulated date, was up and\nrunning with a couple of days to go. The team’s faith was well-rewarded. As\nlaunch day came around, nothing broke.\n\nBagus Santoso and Ardi Priono, QAs on the Trifecta team, recall how everyone\npresent gathered outside the GET office on the day of the soft launch, and\nprayed.\n\n> People of different nationalities, faiths, and professional backgrounds, united\nin a moment of reflection and hope for something they had built together.\nThe day of the soft launch.On November 29, 2018, the GOJEK app successfully went\nlive in Singapore. The next month, December 18 to be precise, GET’s fluorescent\ncolours lit up Bangkok. We were officially live in Thailand. \n\nRiding off to new horizons.> Our SuperApp had ventured beyond home. Team Trifecta\nhad accomplished the task it had been set.\n> Looking back, this had been an ambitious endeavour.

Hands-on sessions and workshops were held, and learnings\ntransferred. The goal now was to provide each team the tools and autonomy\nrequired to not face such roadblocks again.\n\n> Once this process was complete, their task done, the fellowship that steered\nGOJEK to foreign lands was disbanded.\nArmed with new experience, the GOJEK engineers left Trifecta and joined other\nproduct teams.

They moved to\nGOJEK’s newly-formed Kernel team, to help take on one of our biggest challenges\nyet.\n\nBut that is a story for another day.\n\nThis series was a snapshot of how we do things at GOJEK.
